The idea was to convert book ["Rationality: From AI To Zombies" aka "The Sequences"](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality) written by Eliezer Yudkowsky to DocBook for simplify translation and converting book to different formats like PDF for printing and this is done at least at some level.
After that, copy all [existing translations](https://lesswrong.ru/w/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C_%D0%BE%D1%82_%D0%98%D0%98_%D0%B4%D0%BE_%D0%97%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B8) and continue translation to Russian.
