The idea is to convert book "Rationality: From AI To Zombies" aka "The Sequences" written by Eliezer Yudkowsky ([https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality)) to some semantic markup like DocBook for simplify translation and converting book to different formats like PDF for printing.
After that, copy all translations from [https://lesswrong.ru/w](https://lesswrong.ru/w) and continue translation to Russian.
