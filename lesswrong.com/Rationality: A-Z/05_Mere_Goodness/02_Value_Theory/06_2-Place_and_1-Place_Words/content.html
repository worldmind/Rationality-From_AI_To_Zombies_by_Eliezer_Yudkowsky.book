<p>I have previously spoken of the ancient, pulp-era magazine covers that showed a bug-eyed monster carrying off a girl in a torn dress; and about how people think as if sexiness is an inherent property of a sexy entity, without dependence on the admirer.</p>
<p>"Of <em>course</em> the bug-eyed monster will prefer human females to its own kind," says the artist (who we'll call Fred); "it can see that human females have soft, pleasant skin instead of slimy scales.&nbsp; It may be an alien, but it's not <em>stupid</em>&mdash;why are you expecting it to make such a basic mistake about sexiness?"</p>
<p>What is Fred's error?&nbsp; It is treating a function of 2 arguments ("2-place function"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>Sexiness: Admirer, Entity&mdash;&gt; [0, &infin;)</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As though it were a function of 1 argument ("1-place function"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>Sexiness: Entity&mdash;&gt; [0, &infin;)</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Sexiness is treated as a function that accepts only one Entity as its argument, then of course Sexiness will appear to depend only on the Entity, with nothing else being relevant.</p>
<p>When you think about a two-place function as though it were a one-place function, you end up with a <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/variable-questi.html">Variable Question Fallacy</a> / <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/mind-projection.html">Mind Projection Fallacy</a>.&nbsp; Like trying to determine whether a building is <em>intrinsically </em>on the left or on the right side of the road, independent of anyone's travel direction.</p>

<p>An alternative and equally valid standpoint is that "sexiness" <em>does</em> refer to a one-place function&mdash;but each speaker uses a <em>different </em>one-place function to decide who to kidnap and ravish.&nbsp; Who says that just because Fred, the artist, and Bloogah, the bug-eyed monster, both use the word "sexy", they must mean the same thing by it?</p>
<p>If you take this viewpoint, there is no paradox in speaking of some woman intrinsically having 5 units of Fred::Sexiness.&nbsp; All onlookers can agree on this fact, once Fred::Sexiness has been specified in terms of curves, skin texture, clothing, status cues etc.&nbsp; This specification need <em>make no mention of Fred</em>, only the woman to be evaluated.</p>
<p>It so happens that Fred, himself, <em>uses</em> this algorithm to select flirtation targets.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean the algorithm itself has to <em>mention</em> Fred.&nbsp; So Fred's Sexiness function really <em>is</em> a function of one object&mdash;the woman&mdash;on this view.&nbsp; I called it Fred::Sexiness, but remember that this <em>name</em> refers to a function that is being described independently of Fred.&nbsp; Maybe it would be better to write:</p>
<p>Fred::Sexiness == Sexiness_20934</p>
<p>It is an empirical fact about Fred that he uses the function Sexiness_20934 to evaluate potential mates.&nbsp; Perhaps John uses exactly the same algorithm; it doesn't matter where it comes from once we have it.</p>
<p>And similarly, the same woman has only 0.01 units of Sexiness_72546, whereas a slime mold has 3 units of Sexiness_72546.&nbsp; It happens to be an empirical fact that Bloogah uses Sexiness_72546 to decide who to kidnap; that is, Bloogah::Sexiness names the fixed Bloogah-independent mathematical object that is the function Sexiness_72546.</p>
<p>Once we say that the woman has 0.01 units of Sexiness_72546 and 5 units of Sexiness_20934, all observers can agree on this without paradox.</p>
<p>And the two 2-place and 1-place views can be unified using the concept of "currying", named after the mathematician Haskell Curry.&nbsp; Currying is a technique allowed in certain programming language, where e.g. instead of writing</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>x = plus(2, 3)&nbsp; &nbsp; </tt>(x = 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you can also write</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>y = plus(2)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </tt>(y is now a "curried" form of the function <tt>plus</tt>, which has eaten a <tt>2</tt>)<br /><tt>x = y(3)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </tt>(x = 5)<br /><tt>z = y(7)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </tt>(z = 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <tt>plus</tt> is a 2-place function, but currying <tt>plus</tt>&mdash;letting it eat only one of its two required arguments&mdash;turns it into a 1-place function that adds 2 to any input.&nbsp; (Similarly, you could start with a 7-place function, feed it 4 arguments, and the result would be a 3-place function, etc.)</p>
<p>A true purist would insist that all functions should be viewed, by definition, as taking exactly 1 argument.&nbsp; On this view, <tt>plus</tt> accepts 1 numeric input, and outputs a <em>new</em> function; and this <em>new</em> function has 1 numeric input and finally outputs a number.&nbsp; On this view, when we write <tt>plus(2, 3)</tt> we are really computing <tt>plus(2)</tt> to get a function that adds 2 to any input, and then applying the result to <tt>3</tt>.&nbsp; A programmer would write this as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>plus: int&mdash;&gt; (int&mdash;&gt; int)</tt></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This says that <tt>plus</tt> takes an <tt>int</tt> as an argument, and returns a function of type <tt>int&mdash;&gt; int</tt>.</p>
<p>Translating the metaphor back into the human use of words, we could imagine that "sexiness" starts by eating an Admirer, and spits out the fixed <em>mathematical</em> object that describes how the Admirer currently evaluates pulchritude.&nbsp; It is an <em>empirical</em> fact about the Admirer that their intuitions of desirability are computed in a way that is isomorphic to this <em>mathematical</em> function.</p>
<p>Then the mathematical object spit out by currying Sexiness(Admirer) can be applied to the Woman.&nbsp; If the Admirer was originally Fred, Sexiness(Fred) will first return Sexiness_20934.&nbsp; We can then say it is an empirical fact about the <em>Woman</em>, independently of Fred, that Sexiness_20934(Woman) = 5.</p>
<p>In Hilary Putnam's "Twin Earth" thought experiment, there was a tremendous philosophical brouhaha over whether it makes sense to postulate a Twin Earth which is just like our own, except that instead of water being H20, water is a <em>different</em> transparent flowing substance, XYZ.&nbsp; And furthermore, set the time of the thought experiment a few centuries ago, so in neither our Earth nor the Twin Earth does anyone know how to test the alternative hypotheses of H20 vs. XYZ.&nbsp; Does the word "water" <em>mean</em> the same thing in that world, as in this one?</p>
<p>Some said, "Yes, because when an Earth person and a Twin Earth person utter the word 'water', they have the same sensory test in mind."</p>
<p>Some said, "No, because 'water' in our Earth means H20 and 'water' in the Twin Earth means XYZ."</p>
<p>If you think of "water" as a concept that <em>begins</em> by eating a world to find out the empirical true nature of that transparent flowing stuff, and <em>returns</em> a new fixed concept Water_42 or H20, then this world-eating concept is the same in our Earth and the Twin Earth; it just returns different answers in different places.</p>
<p>If you think of "water" as meaning H20 then the concept does nothing different when we transport it between worlds, and the Twin Earth contains no H20.</p>
<p>And of course there is no point in arguing over what the sound of the syllables "wa-ter" <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/disputing-defin.html">really means</a>.</p>
<p>So should you pick one definition and use it consistently?&nbsp; But it's not that easy to save yourself from confusion.&nbsp; You have to train yourself to be <em>deliberately aware</em> of the distinction between the curried and uncurried forms of concepts.</p>
<p>When you take the uncurried water concept and apply it in a different world, it is the same concept but it <em>refers</em> to a different thing; that is, we are applying a constant world-eating function to a different world and obtaining a different return value.&nbsp; In the Twin Earth, XYZ is "water" and H20 is not; in our Earth, H20 is "water" and XYZ is not.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you take "water" to refer to what the prior thinker would call "the result of applying 'water' to <em>our</em> Earth", then in the Twin Earth, XYZ is not water and H20 is.</p>
<p>The whole confusingness of the subsequent philosophical debate, rested on a tendency to <em>instinctively</em> curry concepts or <em>instinctively</em> uncurry them.</p>
<p>Similarly it takes an extra step for Fred to realize that other agents, like the Bug-Eyed-Monster agent, will choose kidnappees for ravishing based on Sexiness<sub>BEM</sub>(Woman), not Sexiness<sub>Fred</sub>(Woman).&nbsp; To do this, Fred must consciously re-envision Sexiness as a function with two arguments.&nbsp; All Fred's brain does by instinct is evaluate <tt>Woman.sexiness</tt>&mdash;that is, Sexiness<sub>Fred</sub>(Woman); but it's simply labeled <tt>Woman.sexiness</tt>.</p>
<p>The fixed mathematical function Sexiness_20934 makes no mention of Fred or the BEM, only women, so Fred does not <em>instinctively</em> see why the BEM would evaluate "sexiness" any differently.&nbsp; And indeed the BEM would <em>not</em> evaluate Sexiness_20934 any differently, if for some odd reason it cared about the result of that particular function; but it is an <em>empirical</em> fact about the BEM that it uses a different function <em>to decide who to kidnap.</em></p>
<p>If you're wondering as to the point of this analysis, we shall need it later in order to <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/taboo-words.html">Taboo</a> such confusing words as "objective", "subjective", and "arbitrary".</p>
