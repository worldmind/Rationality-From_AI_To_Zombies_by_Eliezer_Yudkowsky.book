<p>To those who say "Nothing is real," I once <a href="/lw/q5/quantum_nonrealism/">replied</a>, "That's great, but how does the nothing work?"</p>
<p>Suppose you learned, suddenly and definitively, that nothing is moral and nothing is right; that everything is permissible and nothing is forbidden.</p>
<p>Devastating news, to be sure&mdash;and no, I am not telling you this in real life.&nbsp; But suppose I <em>did</em> tell it to you.&nbsp; Suppose that, whatever you think is the basis of your moral philosophy, I convincingly tore it apart, and moreover showed you that nothing could fill its place.&nbsp; Suppose I <em>proved</em> that all utilities equaled zero.</p>
<p>I know that Your-Moral-Philosophy is as true and undisprovable as <a href="/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/">2 + 2 = 4</a>. But still, I ask that you do your best to perform the thought experiment, and concretely envision the possibilities even if they seem painful, or pointless, or logically incapable of any good reply.</p>
<p>Would you still tip cabdrivers?&nbsp; Would you cheat on your Significant Other?&nbsp; If a child lay fainted on the train tracks, would you still drag them off?</p>
<p>Would you still eat the same kinds of foods&mdash;or would you only eat the cheapest food, since there's no reason you <em>should</em> have fun&mdash;or would you eat very expensive food, since there's no reason you <em>should</em> save money for tomorrow?</p>
<p>Would you wear black and write gloomy poetry and denounce all altruists as fools?&nbsp; But there's no reason you <em>should</em> do that&mdash;it's just a <a href="/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/">cached thought</a>.</p>
<p>Would you stay in bed because there was no reason to get up?&nbsp; What about when you finally got hungry and stumbled into the kitchen&mdash;what would you do after you were done eating?</p>
<p>Would you go on reading <em>Overcoming Bias,</em> and if not, what would you read instead?&nbsp; Would you still try to be rational, and if not, what would you think instead?</p>
<p>Close your eyes, take as long as necessary to answer:</p>
<p>What <em>would</em> you do, if nothing were right?</p>
