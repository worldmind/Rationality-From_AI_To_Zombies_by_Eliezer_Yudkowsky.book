<p>Lewis Carroll, who was also a mathematician, once wrote a short dialogue called <a href="http://www.ditext.com/carroll/tortoise.html">What the Tortoise said to Achilles</a>.&nbsp; If you have not yet read this ancient classic, consider doing so now.</p>
<p>The Tortoise offers Achilles a step of reasoning drawn from Euclid's First Proposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A)&nbsp; Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other.<br />(B)&nbsp; The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the same.<br />(Z)&nbsp; The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tortoise:&nbsp; "And if some reader had <em>not</em> yet accepted A and B as true, he might still accept the <em>sequence</em> as a <em>valid</em> one, I suppose?"</p>
<p>Achilles:&nbsp; &nbsp;"No doubt such a reader might exist.&nbsp; He might say, 'I accept as true the Hypothetical Proposition that, <em>if</em> A and B be true, Z must be true; but, I <em>don't</em> accept A and B as true.'&nbsp; Such a reader would do wisely in abandoning Euclid, and taking to football."</p>
<p>Tortoise:&nbsp; "And might there not <em>also</em> be some reader who would say, 'I accept A and B as true, but I <em>don't</em> accept the Hypothetical'?"</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Achilles, unwisely, concedes this; and so asks the Tortoise to accept another proposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(C)&nbsp; If A and B are true, Z must be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, asks, the Tortoise, suppose that he accepts A and B and C, but not Z?</p>
<p>Then, says, Achilles, he must ask the Tortoise to accept one more hypothetical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(D)&nbsp; If A and B and C are true, Z must be true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Douglas Hofstadter paraphrased the argument some time later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Achilles:&nbsp; If you have [(A⋀B)&rarr;Z], and you also have (A⋀B), then surely you have Z.<br />Tortoise:&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; You mean &lt;{(A⋀B)⋀[(A⋀B)&rarr;Z]}&rarr;Z&gt;, don't you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Hofstadter says, "Whatever Achilles considers a rule of inference, the Tortoise immediately flattens into a mere string of the system.&nbsp; If you use only the letters A, B, and Z, you will get a recursive pattern of longer and longer strings."</p>
<p>By now you should recognize the anti-pattern <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/06/pass-recursive.html">Passing the Recursive Buck</a>; and though the counterspell is sometimes hard to find, when found, it generally takes the form <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/06/causality-and-r.html">The Buck Stops Immediately</a>.</p>
<p>The Tortoise's mind needs the <em>dynamic</em> of adding Y to the belief pool when X and (X&rarr;Y) are previously in the belief pool.&nbsp; If this dynamic is not present&mdash;a rock, for example, lacks it&mdash;then you can go on adding in X and (X&rarr;Y) and (X⋀(X&rarr;Y))&rarr;Y until the end of eternity, without ever getting to Y.</p>
<p>The phrase that once came into my mind to describe this requirement, is that a mind must be <em>created already in motion.</em>&nbsp; There is no argument so compelling that it will give dynamics to a static thing.&nbsp; There is no computer program so <em>persuasive</em> that you can run it on a rock.</p>
<p>And even if you have a mind that <em>does</em> carry out modus ponens, it is futile for it to have such beliefs as...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A)&nbsp; If a toddler is on the train tracks, then pulling them off is fuzzle.<br />(B)&nbsp; There is a toddler on the train tracks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...unless the mind also <em>implements:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Dynamic:</em>&nbsp; When the belief pool contains "X is fuzzle", send X to the action system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<strong>Added:</strong>&nbsp; Apparently this wasn't clear...&nbsp; By "dynamic" I mean a property of a physically implemented cognitive system's <em>development over time</em>.&nbsp; A "dynamic" is something that <em>happens inside</em> a cognitive system, <em>not</em> data that it stores in memory and manipulates.&nbsp; Dynamics are the manipulations.&nbsp; There is no way to write a dynamic on a piece of paper, because the paper will just lie there.&nbsp; So the text immediately above, which says "dynamic", is not dynamic.&nbsp; If I wanted the text to <em>be</em> dynamic and not just <em>say</em> "dynamic", I would have to write a Java applet.)</p>
<p>Needless to say, having the belief...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(C)&nbsp; If the belief pool contains "X is fuzzle", then "send 'X' to the action system" is fuzzle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...won't help unless the mind already implements the <em>behavior</em> of translating hypothetical actions labeled 'fuzzle' into actual motor actions.</p>
<p>By dint of careful arguments about the nature of cognitive systems, you might be able to prove...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(D)&nbsp; &nbsp;A mind with a dynamic that sends plans labeled "fuzzle" to the action system, is more fuzzle than minds that don't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...but that <em>still</em> won't help, unless the listening mind <em>previously</em> possessed the <em>dynamic</em> of swapping out its current source code for alternative source code that is believed to be more fuzzle.</p>
<p>This is why you can't argue fuzzleness into a rock.</p>
