<p>Choose between the following two options:</p><blockquote><p><strong>1A</strong>.&nbsp; $24,000, with certainty.<br /><strong>1B</strong>.&nbsp; 33/34 chance of winning $27,000, and 1/34 chance of winning nothing.</p></blockquote><p>Which seems more intuitively appealing?&nbsp; And which one would you choose in real life?</p><a id="more"></a><p>Now which of these two options would you intuitively prefer, and which would you choose in real life?</p><blockquote><p><strong>2A</strong>. 34% chance of winning $24,000, and 66% chance of winning nothing.<br /><strong>2B</strong>. 33% chance of winning $27,000, and 67% chance of winning nothing.</p></blockquote><p>The Allais Paradox - as Allais called it, though it's not really a paradox - was one of the first conflicts between decision theory and human reasoning to be experimentally exposed, in 1953.&nbsp; I've <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allais_paradox">modified it slightly</a> for ease of math, but the essential problem is the same:&nbsp; Most people prefer 1A &gt; 1B, and most people prefer 2B &gt; 2A.&nbsp; Indeed, in within-subject comparisons, a majority of subjects express both preferences simultaneously.</p>

<p>This is a problem because the 2s are equal to a one-third chance of playing the 1s.&nbsp; That is, 2A is equivalent to playing gamble 1A with 34% probability, and 2B is equivalent to playing 1B with 34% probability.</p>

<p>Among the axioms used to prove that &quot;consistent&quot; decisionmakers can be viewed as maximizing expected utility, is the <a href="http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/uncert/vnmaxioms.htm">Axiom of Independence</a>:&nbsp; If X is strictly preferred to Y, then a probability P of X and (1 - P) of Z should be strictly preferred to P chance of Y and (1 - P) chance of Z.</p>

<p>All the axioms are consequences, as well as antecedents, of a consistent utility function.&nbsp; So it must be possible to prove that the experimental subjects above <em>can't</em> have a consistent utility function over outcomes.&nbsp; And indeed, you can't simultaneously have:</p>

<ul><li>U($24,000)&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;33/34 U($27,000) + 1/34 U($0)</li>

<li>0.34 U($24,000) + 0.66 U($0)&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;&nbsp; &nbsp;0.33 U($27,000) + 0.67 U($0)</li></ul> <p>These two equations are algebraically inconsistent, regardless of U, so the Allais Paradox has nothing to do with the diminishing marginal utility of money.</p>

<p>Maurice Allais initially defended the revealed preferences of the experimental subjects - he saw the experiment as exposing a flaw in the conventional ideas of utility, rather than exposing a flaw in human psychology.&nbsp; This was 1953, after all, and the heuristics-and-biases movement wouldn't really get started for another two decades.&nbsp; Allais thought his experiment just showed that the Axiom of Independence clearly wasn't a good idea in real life.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/beautiful-proba.html">How naive, how foolish, how simplistic</a> is Bayesian decision theory...)</p>

<p>Surely, the <em>certainty</em> of having $24,000 should count for <em>something.</em>&nbsp; You can <em>feel</em> the difference, right?&nbsp; The solid reassurance?</p>

<p>(I'm starting to think of this as &quot;naive philosophical realism&quot; - supposing that our <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/a-priori.html">intuitions directly expose truths</a> about which strategies are wiser, as though it was a directly perceived fact that &quot;1A is superior to 1B&quot;.&nbsp; Intuitions <em>directly</em> expose truths about human cognitive functions, and only <em>indirectly</em> expose (after we <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/the-lens-that-s.html">reflect on the cognitive functions</a> themselves) truths about rationality.)</p>

<p>&quot;But come now,&quot; you say, &quot;is it really such a terrible thing, to depart from <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/beautiful-proba.html">Bayesian beauty</a>?&quot;&nbsp; Okay, so the subjects didn't follow the neat little &quot;independence axiom&quot; espoused by the likes of von Neumann and Morgenstern.&nbsp; Yet who says that things <em>must</em> be neat and tidy?</p>

<p>Why fret about elegance, if it makes us take risks we don't want?&nbsp; <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/terminal-values.html">Expected utility</a> tells us that we ought to assign some kind of number to an outcome, and then multiply that value by the outcome's probability, add them up, etc.&nbsp; Okay, but why do we <em>have</em> to do that?&nbsp; Why not make up more palatable rules instead?</p>

<p>There is always a price for leaving the Bayesian Way.&nbsp; That's what coherence and uniqueness theorems are all about.</p>

<p>In this case, if an agent prefers 1A &gt; 1B, and 2B &gt; 2A, it introduces a form of <em>preference reversal -</em> a <em>dynamic inconsistency</em> in the agent's planning.&nbsp; You become a <em>money pump.</em></p>

<p>Suppose that at 12:00PM I roll a hundred-sided die.&nbsp; If the die shows a number greater than 34, the game terminates.&nbsp; Otherwise, at 12:05PM I consult a switch with two settings, A and B.&nbsp; If the setting is A, I pay you $24,000.&nbsp; If the setting is B, I roll a 34-sided die and pay you $27,000 unless the die shows &quot;34&quot;, in which case I pay you nothing.</p>

<p>Let's say you prefer 1A over 1B, and 2B over 2A, and you would pay a single penny to indulge each preference.&nbsp; The switch starts in state A.&nbsp; Before 12:00PM, you pay me a penny to throw the switch to B.&nbsp; The die comes up 12.&nbsp; After 12:00PM and before 12:05PM, you pay me a penny to throw the switch to A.</p>

<p>I have taken your two cents on the subject.</p><p>If you indulge your intuitions, and dismiss mere elegance as a pointless obsession with neatness, then don't be surprised when your pennies get taken from you...</p>

<p>(I think the same failure to <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/still-a-chance.html">proportionally devalue the emotional impact of small probabilities</a> is responsible for the <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/04/new_improved_lo.html">lottery</a>.)<br /></p>
