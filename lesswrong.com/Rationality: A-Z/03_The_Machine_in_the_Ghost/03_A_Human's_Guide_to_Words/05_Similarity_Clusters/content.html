<p>Once upon a time, the philosophers of Plato's Academy claimed that the best definition of human was a "featherless biped".&nbsp; Diogenes of Sinope, also called Diogenes the Cynic, is said to have promptly exhibited a plucked chicken and declared "Here is Plato's man."&nbsp; The Platonists promptly changed their definition to "a featherless biped with broad nails".</p>
<p>No dictionary, no encyclopedia, has ever listed all the things that humans have in common.&nbsp; We have red blood, five fingers on each of two hands, bony skulls, 23 pairs of chromosomes&mdash;but the same might be said of other animal species.&nbsp; We make complex tools to make complex tools, we use syntactical combinatorial language, we harness critical fission reactions as a source of energy: these things may serve out to single out only humans, but not all humans&mdash;many of us have never built a fission reactor.&nbsp; With the right set of necessary-and-sufficient gene sequences you could single out all humans, and only humans&mdash;at least for now&mdash;but it would still be far from <em>all</em> that humans have in common.<br /><br />But so long as you don't happen to be near a plucked chicken, saying "Look for featherless bipeds" may serve to pick out a few dozen of the particular things that are humans, as opposed to houses, vases, sandwiches, cats, colors, or mathematical theorems.</p>

<p>Once the definition "featherless biped" has been bound to some <em>particular</em> featherless bipeds, you can look over the group, and begin harvesting some of the <em>other</em> characteristics&mdash;beyond mere featherfree twolegginess&mdash;that the "featherless bipeds" seem to share in common.&nbsp; The particular featherless bipeds that you see seem to also use language, build complex tools, speak combinatorial language with syntax, bleed red blood if poked, die when they drink hemlock.</p>
<p>Thus the category "human" grows richer, and adds more and more characteristics; and when Diogenes finally presents his plucked chicken, we are not fooled:&nbsp; This plucked chicken is obviously not similar to the other "featherless bipeds".</p>
<p>(If Aristotelian logic were a good model of human psychology, the Platonists would have looked at the plucked chicken and said, "Yes, that's a human; what's your point?")</p>
<p>If the <em>first</em> featherless biped you see is a plucked chicken, then you may end up thinking that the verbal label "human" denotes a plucked chicken; so I can modify my treasure map to point to "featherless bipeds with broad nails", and if I am wise, go on to say, "See Diogenes over there?&nbsp; That's a human, and I'm a human, and you're a human; and that chimpanzee is not a human, though fairly close."</p>
<p>The initial clue only has to lead the user to the similarity cluster&mdash;the group of things that have many characteristics in common.&nbsp; After that, the initial clue has served its purpose, and I can go on to convey the new information "humans are currently mortal", or whatever else I want to say about us featherless bipeds.</p>
<p>A dictionary is best thought of, not as a book of Aristotelian class definitions, but a book of hints for matching verbal labels to similarity clusters, or matching labels to properties that are useful in distinguishing similarity clusters.</p>
