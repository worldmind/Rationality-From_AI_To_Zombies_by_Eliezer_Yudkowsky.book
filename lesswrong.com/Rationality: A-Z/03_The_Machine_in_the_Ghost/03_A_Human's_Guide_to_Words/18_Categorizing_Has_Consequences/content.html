<p>Among the many genetic variations and mutations you carry in your genome, there are a very few alleles you probably know&mdash;including those determining your blood type: the presence or absence of the A, B, and + antigens.&nbsp; If you receive a blood transfusion containing an antigen you don't have, it will trigger an allergic reaction.&nbsp; It was Karl Landsteiner's discovery of this fact, and how to test for compatible blood types, that made it possible to transfuse blood without killing the patient.&nbsp; (1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine.)&nbsp; Also, if a mother with blood type A (for example) bears a child with blood type A+, the mother may acquire an allergic reaction to the + antigen; if she has another child with blood type A+, the child will be in danger, unless the mother takes an allergic suppressant during pregnancy.&nbsp; Thus people learn their blood types before they marry.</p>
<p>Oh, and <em>also:</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> people with blood type A are earnest and creative, while people with blood type B are wild and cheerful.&nbsp; People with type O are agreeable and sociable, while people with type AB are cool and controlled. (You would think that O would be the absence of A and B, while AB would just be A plus B, but no...)&nbsp; All this, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_blood_type_theory_of_personality">the Japanese blood type theory of personality</a>.&nbsp; It would seem that blood type plays the role in Japan that astrological signs play in the West, right down to blood type horoscopes in the daily newspaper.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-style: normal;">This fad is especially odd because blood types have </span><em>never been</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> mysterious, not in Japan and not anywhere.&nbsp; We only know blood types even </span><em>exist</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> thanks to Karl Landsteiner.&nbsp; No mystic witch doctor, no venerable sorcerer, ever said a word about blood types; there are no ancient, dusty scrolls to shroud the error in the <a href="/lw/lz/guardians_of_the_truth/">aura of antiquity</a>.&nbsp; If the medical profession claimed tomorrow that it had all been a colossal hoax, we layfolk would not have one scrap of evidence from our unaided senses to contradict them.</span></p>
<p>There's never been a war between blood types.&nbsp; There's never even been a political conflict between blood types.&nbsp; The stereotypes must have arisen <em>strictly</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> from the </span><em>mere existence</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> of the labels.</span></p>

<p>Now, someone is bound to point out that this is a story of categorizing humans.&nbsp; Does the same thing happen if you categorize plants, or rocks, or office furniture?&nbsp; I can't recall reading about such an experiment, but of course, <a href="/lw/kj/no_one_knows_what_science_doesnt_know/">that doesn't mean one hasn't been done</a>.&nbsp; (I'd expect the chief difficulty of doing such an experiment would be finding a protocol that didn't mislead the subjects into thinking that, since the label was given you, it must be significant somehow.)&nbsp; So while I don't mean to update on imaginary evidence, I would predict a positive result for the experiment:&nbsp; I would expect them to find that mere labeling had power over all things, at least in the human imagination.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">You can see this in terms of <a href="/lw/nj/similarity_clusters/">similarity clusters</a>: once you draw a boundary around a group, the mind starts trying to harvest similarities from the group.&nbsp; And unfortunately the human pattern-detectors seem to operate in such overdrive that we see patterns whether they're there or not; a weakly negative correlation can be mistaken for a strong positive one with a bit of selective memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">You can see this in terms of <a href="/lw/nn/neural_categories/">neural algorithms</a>: creating a name for a set of things is like allocating a subnetwork to find patterns in them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">You can see this in terms of a <a href="/lw/nw/fallacies_of_compression/">compression fallacy</a>: things given the same name end up dumped into the same mental bucket, blurring them together into the same point on the map.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">Or you can see this in terms of the boundless human ability to make stuff up out of thin air and believe it because <a href="/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/">no one can prove it's wrong</a>.&nbsp; As soon as you name the category, you can start making up stuff about it.&nbsp; The named thing doesn't have to be perceptible; it doesn't have to exist; it doesn't even have to be coherent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">And no, it's not just Japan:&nbsp; Here in the West, a blood-type-based diet book called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_diet">Eat Right 4 Your Type</a> was a bestseller.</span></p>
<p>Any way you look at it, drawing a boundary in <a href="/lw/nl/the_cluster_structure_of_thingspace/">thingspace</a> is not a neutral act.&nbsp; Maybe a more cleanly designed, more purely Bayesian AI could ponder an arbitrary class and not be influenced by it.&nbsp; But you, a human, do not have that option.&nbsp; Categories are not static things in the context of a human brain; as soon as you actually think of them, they exert force on your mind.&nbsp; One more reason not to believe you can define a word any way you like.</p>
