<blockquote>
<p>Albert:&nbsp; "Every time I've listened to a tree fall, it made a sound, so I'll guess that other trees falling also make sounds.&nbsp; I don't believe the world changes around when I'm not looking."<br />Barry:&nbsp; "Wait a minute.&nbsp; If no one hears it, how can it be a sound?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While writing the dialogue of Albert and Barry in their <a href="/lw/np/disputing_definitions/">dispute</a> over whether a falling tree in a deserted forest makes a sound, I sometimes found myself losing empathy with my characters.&nbsp; I would start to lose the gut feel of why <em>anyone</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> would ever argue like that, even though I'd seen it happen many times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">On these occasions, I would repeat to myself, "Either the falling tree makes a sound, or it does not!" to restore my borrowed sense of indignation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">(P or ~P) is not always a reliable heuristic, if you substitute arbitrary English sentences for P.&nbsp; "This sentence is false" cannot be consistently viewed as true or false.&nbsp; And then there's the old classic, "Have you stopped beating your wife?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">Now if you are a mathematician, and one who believes in classical (rather than intuitionistic) logic, there are ways to continue insisting that (P or ~P) is a theorem: for example, saying that "This sentence is false" is not a sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">But such resolutions are subtle, which suffices to demonstrate a need for subtlety.&nbsp; You cannot just bull ahead on every occasion with "Either it does or it doesn't!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">So does the falling tree make a sound, or not, or...?</span></p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">Surely, 2 + 2 = X or it does not?&nbsp; Well, maybe, </span><em>if</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> it's <em>really</em> the same X, the same 2, and the same + and =.&nbsp; If X evaluates to 5 on some occasions and 4 on another, your indignation may be misplaced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">To even begin claiming that (P or ~P) ought to be a necessary truth, the symbol P must stand for <em>exactly</em> the same thing in both halves of the dilemma.&nbsp; "Either the fall makes a sound, or not!"&mdash;but if Albert::sound is not the same as Barry::sound, there is nothing paradoxical about the tree making an Albert::sound but not a Barry::sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">(The :: idiom is something I picked up in my C++ days for avoiding namespace collisions.&nbsp; If you've got two different packages that define a class Sound, you can write Package1::Sound to specify which Sound you mean.&nbsp; The idiom is not widely known, I think; which is a pity, because I often wish I could use it in writing.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">The variability may be subtle:&nbsp; Albert and Barry may carefully verify that it is the same tree, in the same forest, and the same occasion of falling, just to ensure that they really do have a substantive disagreement about exactly the same event.&nbsp; And then forget to check that they are matching this event against exactly the same concept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">Think about the grocery store that you visit most often:&nbsp; Is it on the left side of the street, or the right?&nbsp; But of course there is no "<em>the</em> left side" of the street, only <em>your</em> left side, as you travel along it from some particular direction.&nbsp; Many of the words we use are really functions of implicit variables supplied by context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">It's actually one heck of a pain, requiring one heck of a lot of work, to handle this kind of problem in an Artificial Intelligence program intended to parse language&mdash;the phenomenon going by the name of "speaker deixis".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">"Martin told Bob the building was on his left."&nbsp; But&nbsp; "left" is a function-word that evaluates with a speaker-dependent variable invisibly grabbed from the surrounding context.&nbsp; Whose "left" is meant, Bob's or Martin's?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">The variables in a variable question fallacy often aren't neatly labeled&mdash;it's not as simple as "Say, do you think Z + 2 equals 6?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">If a <a href="/lw/nu/taboo_your_words/">namespace collision</a> introduces two different concepts that look like "the same concept" because they have the same name&mdash;or a <a href="/lw/nw/fallacies_of_compression/">map compression</a> introduces two different events that look like the same event because they don't have separate mental files&mdash;or the same function evaluates in different contexts&mdash;then reality itself becomes protean, changeable.&nbsp; At least that's what the </span><a href="/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/"><span style="font-style: normal;">algorithm feels like from inside</span></a><span style="font-style: normal;">.&nbsp; Your mind's eye sees the map, not the territory directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">If you have a question with a hidden variable, that evaluates to different expressions in different contexts, it </span><em>feels like</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> reality itself is unstable&mdash;what your mind's eye sees, shifts around depending on where it looks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">This often confuses undergraduates (and postmodernist professors) who discover a sentence with more than one interpretation; they think they have discovered an unstable portion of reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">"Oh my gosh!&nbsp; 'The Sun goes around the Earth' is true for </span><span style="font-style: normal;">Hunga Huntergatherer</span><span style="font-style: normal;">, but for Amara Astronomer, 'The Sun goes around the Earth' is false!&nbsp; There is no fixed truth!"&nbsp; The deconstruction of this sophomoric nitwittery is left as an exercise to the reader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">And yet, even I initially found myself writing "If X is 5 on some occasions and 4 on another, the sentence '2 + 2 = X' may have no fixed truth-value."&nbsp; There is not <em>one</em> sentence with a <em>variable</em> truth-value.&nbsp; "2 + 2 = X" <em>has no</em> truth-value.&nbsp; It is not a <em>proposition,</em> not yet, not as mathematicians define proposition-ness, any more than "2 + 2 =" is a proposition, or "Fred jumped over the" is a grammatical sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal;">But this fallacy tends to sneak in, even when you allegedly know better, because, well, that's how the <a href="/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/">algorithm feels from inside</a>.</span></p>
