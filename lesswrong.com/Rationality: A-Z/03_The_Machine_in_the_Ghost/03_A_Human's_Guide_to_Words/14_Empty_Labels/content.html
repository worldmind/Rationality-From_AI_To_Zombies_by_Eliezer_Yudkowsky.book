<p>Consider (yet again) the Aristotelian idea of categories.&nbsp; Let's say that there's some object with properties A, B, C, D, and E, or at least it looks E-ish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fred:&nbsp; "You mean that thing over there is blue, round, fuzzy, and&mdash;"<br />Me: "In Aristotelian logic, it's not supposed to make a difference what the properties are, or what I call them.&nbsp; That's why I'm just using the letters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, I invent the Aristotelian category "zawa", which describes those objects, all those objects, and only those objects, which have properties A, C, and D.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me:&nbsp; "Object 1 is zawa, B, and E."<br />Fred:&nbsp; "And it's blue&mdash;I mean, A&mdash;too, right?"<br />Me:&nbsp; "That's implied when I say it's zawa."<br />Fred:&nbsp; "Still, I'd like you to say it explicitly."<br />Me:&nbsp; "Okay.&nbsp; Object 1 is A, B, zawa, and E."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Then I add another word, "yokie", which describes all and only objects that are B and E; and the word "xippo", which describes all and only objects which are E but not D.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me:&nbsp; "Object 1 is zawa and yokie, but not xippo."<br />Fred:&nbsp; "Wait, is it luminescent?&nbsp; I mean, is it E?"<br />Me:&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; That is the only possibility on the information given."<br />Fred:&nbsp; "I'd rather you spelled it out."<br />Me:&nbsp; "Fine:&nbsp; Object 1 is A, zawa, B, yokie, C, D, E, and not xippo."<br />Fred:&nbsp; "Amazing!&nbsp; You can tell all that just by looking?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impressive, isn't it?&nbsp; Let's invent even more new words:&nbsp; "Bolo" is A, C, and yokie; "mun" is A, C, and xippo; and "merlacdonian" is bolo and mun.</p>
<p>Pointlessly confusing?&nbsp; I think so too.&nbsp; Let's replace the labels with the definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Zawa, B, and E" becomes [A, C, D], B, E<br />"Bolo and A" becomes [A, C, [B, E]], A<br />"Merlacdonian" becomes [A, C, [B, E]], [A, C, [E, ~D]]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the thing to remember about the Aristotelian idea of categories is that [A, C, D] is the <em>entire</em> information of "zawa".&nbsp; It's not just that I can vary the label, but that I can get along just fine without any label at all&mdash;the rules for Aristotelian classes work purely on structures like [A, C, D].&nbsp; To call one of these structures "zawa", or attach any other label to it, is a human convenience (or inconvenience) which makes not the slightest difference to the Aristotelian rules.</p>
<p>Let's say that "human" is to be defined as a mortal featherless biped.&nbsp; Then the <a href="/lw/nf/the_parable_of_hemlock/">classic syllogism</a> would have the form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All [mortal, ~feathers, bipedal] are mortal.<br />Socrates is a [mortal, ~feathers, bipedal].<br />Therefore, Socrates is mortal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The feat of reasoning looks a lot less impressive now, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Here the <em>illusion of inference</em> comes from the labels, which conceal the premises, and pretend to novelty in the conclusion.&nbsp; Replacing labels with definitions reveals the illusion, making visible the tautology's <a href="/lw/nf/the_parable_of_hemlock/">empirical unhelpfulness</a>.&nbsp; You can never say that Socrates is a [mortal, ~feathers, biped] until you have observed him to be mortal.</p>
<p>There's an idea, which you may have noticed I hate, that "you can define a word any way you like".&nbsp; This idea came from the Aristotelian notion of categories; since, if you follow the Aristotelian rules <em>exactly</em> and <em>without flaw</em>&mdash;<a href="/lw/ng/words_as_hidden_inferences/">which humans never do</a>; Aristotle knew perfectly well that Socrates was human, even though that wasn't justified under his rules&mdash;but, <em>if</em> some imaginary nonhuman entity were to follow the rules exactly, they would never arrive at a contradiction.&nbsp; They wouldn't arrive at much of anything: they couldn't say that Socrates is a [mortal, ~feathers, biped] until they observed him to be mortal.</p>
<p>But it's not so much that labels are <em>arbitrary</em> in the Aristotelian system, as that the Aristotelian system works fine without <em>any labels at all</em>&mdash;it cranks out exactly the same stream of tautologies, they just look a lot less impressive.&nbsp; The labels are only there to create the <em>illusion</em> of inference.</p>
<p>So if you're going to have an Aristotelian proverb at all, the proverb should be, not "I can define a word any way I like," nor even, "Defining a word never has any consequences," but rather, "Definitions don't need words."</p>
