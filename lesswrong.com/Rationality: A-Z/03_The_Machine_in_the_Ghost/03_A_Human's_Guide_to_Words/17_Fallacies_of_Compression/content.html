<p>"The map is not the territory," as the saying goes.&nbsp; The only life-size, atomically detailed, 100% accurate map of California is California.&nbsp; But California has important regularities, such as the shape of its highways, that can be described using vastly less information&mdash;not to mention vastly less <em>physical material</em>&mdash;than it would take to describe every atom within the state borders.&nbsp; Hence the <em>other</em> saying:&nbsp; "The map is not the territory, but you can't fold up the territory and put it in your glove compartment."</p>
<p>A paper map of California, at a scale of 10 kilometers to 1 centimeter (a million to one), doesn't have room to show the distinct position of two fallen leaves lying a centimeter apart on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Even if the map tried to show the leaves, the leaves would appear as the same point on the map; or rather the map would need a feature size of 10 nanometers, which is a finer resolution than most book printers handle, not to mention human eyes.</p>
<p>Reality is very large&mdash;just the part we can see is billions of lightyears across.&nbsp; But your map of reality is written on a few pounds of neurons, folded up to fit inside your skull.&nbsp; I don't mean to be insulting, but your skull is tiny, comparatively speaking.</p>
<p>Inevitably, then, certain things that are distinct in reality, will be compressed into the same point on your map.</p>
<p>But what this <a href="/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/">feels like from inside</a> is not that you say, "Oh, look, I'm compressing two things into one point on my map."&nbsp; What it <em>feels </em>like from inside is that there is just <em>one</em> thing, and you are seeing it.</p>

<p>A sufficiently young child, or a sufficiently ancient Greek philosopher, would not know that there were such things as "acoustic vibrations" or "auditory experiences".&nbsp; There would just be a single thing that happened when a tree fell; a single event called "sound".</p>
<p>To realize that there are <em>two</em> distinct events, underlying <em>one</em> point on your map, is an essentially <em>scientific</em> challenge&mdash;a big, difficult scientific challenge.</p>
<p>Sometimes fallacies of compression result from confusing two known things under the same label&mdash;you know about acoustic vibrations, and you know about auditory processing in brains, but you call them both "sound" and so confuse yourself.&nbsp; But the more dangerous fallacy of compression arises from having <em>no idea whatsoever</em> that two distinct entities even <em>exist</em>.&nbsp; There is just one mental folder in the filing system, labeled "sound", and everything thought about "sound" drops into that one folder.&nbsp; It's not that there are two folders with the same label; there's just a single folder.&nbsp; By default, the map is compressed; why would the brain create two mental buckets where one would serve?</p>
<p>Or think of a mystery novel in which the detective's critical insight is that one of the suspects has an identical twin.&nbsp; In the course of the detective's ordinary work, his job is just to observe that Carol is wearing red, that she has black hair, that her sandals are leather&mdash;but all these are <em>facts about</em> Carol.&nbsp; It's easy enough to question an individual fact, like WearsRed(Carol) or BlackHair(Carol).&nbsp; Maybe BlackHair(Carol) is false.&nbsp; Maybe Carol dyes her hair.&nbsp; Maybe BrownHair(Carol).&nbsp; But it takes a subtler detective to wonder if the Carol in WearsRed(Carol) and BlackHair(Carol)&mdash;the Carol file into which his observations drop&mdash;should be split into <em>two</em> files.&nbsp; Maybe there are two Carols, so that the Carol who wore red is not the same woman as the Carol who had black hair.</p>
<p>Here it is the very act of <em>creating</em> two different buckets that is the stroke of genius insight.&nbsp; 'Tis easier to question one's facts than one's ontology.</p>
<p>The map of reality contained in a human brain, unlike a paper map of California, can expand dynamically when we write down more detailed descriptions.&nbsp; But what this feels like from inside is not so much zooming in on a map, as fissioning an indivisible atom&mdash;taking <em>one thing</em> (it felt like one thing) and splitting it into two or more things.</p>
<p>Often this manifests in the creation of new words, like "acoustic vibrations" and "auditory experiences" instead of just "sound".&nbsp; Something about creating the new name seems to allocate the new bucket.&nbsp; The detective is liable to start calling one of his suspects "Carol-2" or "the Other Carol" almost as soon as he realizes that there are two of them.</p>
<p>But expanding the map isn't always as simple as generating new city names.&nbsp; It is a stroke of scientific insight to realize that such things as acoustic vibrations, or auditory experiences, even <em>exist.</em></p>
<p>The obvious modern-day illustration would be words like "intelligence" or "consciousness".&nbsp; Every now and then one sees a press release claiming that a research has "explained consciousness" because a team of neurologists investigated a 40Hz electrical rhythm that might have something to do with cross-modality binding of sensory information, or because they investigated the reticular activating system that keeps humans awake.&nbsp; That's an extreme example, and the usual failures are more subtle, but they are of the same kind.&nbsp; The part of "consciousness" that people find most interesting is reflectivity, self-awareness, realizing that the person I see in the mirror is "me"; that and the hard problem of subjective experience as distinguished by Chalmers.&nbsp; We also label "conscious" the state of being awake, rather than asleep, in our daily cycle.&nbsp; But they are all different concepts going under the same name, and the underlying phenomena are different scientific puzzles.&nbsp; You can explain being awake without explaining reflectivity or subjectivity.</p>
<p>Fallacies of compression also underlie the bait-and-switch technique in philosophy&mdash;you argue about "consciousness" under one definition (like the ability to think about thinking) and then apply the conclusions to "consciousness" under a different definition (like subjectivity).&nbsp; Of course it may be that the two are the same thing, but if so, genuinely <em>understanding</em> this fact would require <em>first</em> a conceptual split and <em>then</em> a genius stroke of reunification.</p>
<p>Expanding your map is (I say again) a <em>scientific</em> challenge: part of the art of science, the skill of inquiring into the world.&nbsp; (And of course you cannot solve a scientific challenge by appealing to dictionaries, nor master a complex skill of inquiry by saying "I can define a word any way I like".)&nbsp; Where you see a single confusing thing, with protean and self-contradictory attributes, it is a good guess that your map is cramming too much into one point&mdash;you need to pry it apart and allocate some new buckets.&nbsp; This is not like <em>defining</em> the single thing you see, but it <em>does</em> often follow from figuring out how to talk about the thing without using a single mental handle.</p>
<p>So the skill of prying apart the map is linked to the <a href="/lw/nv/replace_the_symbol_with_the_substance/">rationalist version</a> of <a href="/lw/nu/taboo_your_words/">Taboo</a>, and to the wise use of words; because words often represent the points on our map, the labels under which we file our propositions and the buckets into which we drop our information.&nbsp; Avoiding a single word, or allocating new ones, is often part of the skill of expanding the map.</p>
