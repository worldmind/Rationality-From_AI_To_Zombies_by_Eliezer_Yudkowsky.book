<p>The notion of a "configuration space" is a way of translating object <em>descriptions</em> into object <em>positions.</em>&nbsp; It may seem like <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span> is "closer" to <span style="color: #009966;">blue-green</span> than to <span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span>, but how much closer?&nbsp; It's hard to answer that question by just staring at the colors.&nbsp; But it helps to know that the (proportional) color coordinates in RGB are 0:0:5, 0:3:2 and 5:0:0.&nbsp; It would be even clearer if plotted on a 3D graph.</p>
<p>In the same way, you can see a robin as a robin&mdash;brown tail, red breast, standard robin shape, maximum flying speed when unladen, its species-typical DNA and individual alleles.&nbsp; Or you could see a robin as a single point in a configuration space whose dimensions described everything we knew, or could know, about the robin.</p>
<p>A robin is bigger than a virus, and smaller than an aircraft carrier&mdash;that might be the "volume" dimension.&nbsp; Likewise a robin weighs more than a hydrogen atom, and less than a galaxy; that might be the "mass" dimension.&nbsp; Different robins will have strong correlations between "volume" and "mass", so the robin-points will be lined up in a fairly linear string, in those two dimensions&mdash;but the correlation won't be exact, so we do need two separate dimensions.</p>
<p>This is the benefit of viewing robins as points in space:&nbsp; You couldn't see the linear lineup as easily if you were just imagining the robins as cute little wing-flapping creatures.</p>

<p>A robin's DNA is a highly multidimensional variable, but you can still think of it as part of a robin's location in thingspace&mdash;millions of quaternary coordinates, one coordinate for each DNA base&mdash;or maybe a more sophisticated view that .&nbsp; The shape of the robin, and its color (surface reflectance), you can likewise think of as part of the robin's position in thingspace, even though they aren't <em>single</em> dimensions.</p>
<p>Just like the coordinate point 0:0:5 contains the same information as the actual HTML color <span style="color: #0000ff;">blue</span>, we shouldn't actually lose information when we see robins as points in space.&nbsp; We believe the same statement about the robin's mass whether we visualize a robin balancing the scales opposite a 0.07-kilogram weight, or a robin-point with a mass-coordinate of +70.</p>
<p>We can even imagine a configuration space with one or more dimensions for every distinct characteristic of an object, so that the <em>position</em> of an object's point in this space corresponds to <em>all</em> the information in the real object itself.&nbsp; Rather redundantly represented, too&mdash;dimensions would include the mass, the volume, and the density.</p>
<p>If you think that's extravagant, quantum physicists use an <em>infinite-dimensional</em> configuration space, and a single point in that space describes the location of every particle in the universe.&nbsp; So we're actually being comparatively conservative in our visualization of <em>thingspace</em>&mdash;a point in thingspace describes just one object, not the entire universe.</p>
<p>If we're not sure of the robin's exact mass and volume, then we can think of a little cloud in thingspace, a <em>volume of uncertainty</em>, within which the robin might be.&nbsp; The density of the cloud is the density of our belief that the robin has that particular mass and volume.&nbsp; If you're more sure of the robin's density than of its mass and volume, your probability-cloud will be highly concentrated in the density dimension, and concentrated around a slanting line in the subspace of mass/volume.&nbsp; (Indeed, the cloud here is actually a surface, because of the relation VD = M.)</p>
<p>"Radial categories" are how cognitive psychologists describe the non-Aristotelian boundaries of words.&nbsp; The central "mother" conceives her child, gives birth to it, and supports it. Is an egg donor who never sees her child a mother?&nbsp; She is the "genetic mother".&nbsp; What about a woman who is implanted with a foreign embryo and bears it to term?&nbsp; She is a "surrogate mother".&nbsp; And the woman who raises a child that isn't hers genetically?&nbsp; Why, she's an "adoptive mother".&nbsp; The Aristotelian syllogism would run, "Humans have ten fingers, Fred has nine fingers, therefore Fred is not a human" but the way we actually think is "Humans have ten fingers, Fred is a human, therefore Fred is a 'nine-fingered human'."</p>
<p>We can think about the radial-ness of categories in intensional terms, as described above&mdash;properties that are usually present, but optionally absent.&nbsp; If we thought about the intension of the word "mother", it might be like a distributed glow in thingspace, a glow whose intensity matches the degree to which that volume of thingspace matches the category "mother".&nbsp; The glow is concentrated in the center of genetics and birth and child-raising; the volume of egg donors would also glow, but less brightly.</p>
<p>Or we can think about the radial-ness of categories extensionally.&nbsp; Suppose we mapped all the birds in the world into thingspace, using a distance metric that corresponds as well as possible to perceived similarity in humans:&nbsp; A robin is more similar to another robin, than either is similar to a pigeon, but robins and pigeons are all more similar to each other than either is to a penguin, etcetera.</p>
<p>Then the center of all birdness would be densely populated by many neighboring tight clusters, robins and sparrows and canaries and pigeons and many other species.&nbsp; Eagles and falcons and other large predatory birds would occupy a nearby cluster.&nbsp; Penguins would be in a more distant cluster, and likewise chickens and ostriches.</p>
<p>The result might look, indeed, something like an astronomical cluster: many galaxies orbiting the center, and a few outliers.</p>
<p>Or we could think simultaneously about both the intension of the cognitive category "bird", and its extension in real-world birds:&nbsp; The central clusters of robins and sparrows glowing brightly with highly typical birdness; satellite clusters of ostriches and penguins glowing more dimly with atypical birdness, and Abraham Lincoln a few megaparsecs away and glowing not at all.</p>
<p>I prefer that last visualization&mdash;the glowing points&mdash;because as I see it, the structure of the cognitive intension followed from the extensional cluster structure.&nbsp; First came the structure-in-the-world, the empirical distribution of birds over thingspace; then, by observing it, we formed a category whose intensional glow roughly overlays this structure.</p>
<p>This gives us yet another view of why words are not Aristotelian classes: the empirical clustered structure of the real universe is not so crystalline.&nbsp; A natural cluster, a group of things highly similar to each other, may have <em>no</em> set of necessary and sufficient properties&mdash;<em>no</em> set of characteristics that all group members have, and no non-members have.</p>
<p>But even if a category is irrecoverably blurry and bumpy, there's no need to panic.&nbsp; I would not object if someone said that birds are "feathered flying things".&nbsp; <em>But penguins don't fly!</em>&mdash;well, fine.&nbsp; The usual rule has an exception; it's not the end of the world.&nbsp; Definitions can't be expected to exactly match the empirical structure of thingspace in any event, because the map is smaller and much less complicated than the territory.&nbsp; The point of the definition "feathered flying things" is to lead the listener to the bird cluster, not to give a total description of every existing bird down to the molecular level.</p>
<p>When you draw a boundary around a group of extensional points <em>empirically</em> clustered in thingspace, you may find at least one exception to every simple intensional rule you can invent.</p>
<p>But if a definition works well enough in practice to point out the intended empirical cluster, objecting to it may justly be called "nitpicking".</p>
