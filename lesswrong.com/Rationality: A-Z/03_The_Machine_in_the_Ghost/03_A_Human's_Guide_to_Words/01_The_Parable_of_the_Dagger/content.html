<p>Once upon a time, there was a court jester who dabbled in logic.</p>
<p>The jester presented the king with two boxes.&nbsp; Upon the first box was inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Either this box contains an angry frog, or the box with a false inscription contains an angry frog, but not both."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the second box was inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Either this box contains gold and the box with a false inscription contains an angry frog, or this box contains an angry frog and the box with a true inscription contains gold."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the jester said to the king:&nbsp; "One box contains an angry frog, the other box gold; and one, and only one, of the inscriptions is true."</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>The king opened the wrong box, and was savaged by an angry frog.</p>
<p>"You see," the jester said, "let us hypothesize that the first inscription is the true one.&nbsp; Then suppose the first box contains gold.&nbsp; Then the other box would have an angry frog, while the box with a true inscription would contain gold, which would make the second statement true as well.&nbsp; Now hypothesize that the first inscription is false, and that the first box contains gold.&nbsp; Then the second inscription would be&mdash;"</p>
<p>The king ordered the jester thrown in the dungeons.</p>
<p>A day later, the jester was brought before the king in chains, and shown two boxes.</p>
<p>"One box contains a key," said the king, "to unlock your chains; and if you find the key you are free.&nbsp; But the other box contains a dagger for your heart, if you fail."</p>
<p>And the first box was inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Either both inscriptions are true, or both inscriptions are false."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the second box was inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This box contains the key."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jester reasoned thusly:&nbsp; "Suppose the first inscription is true.&nbsp; Then the second inscription must also be true.&nbsp; Now suppose the first inscription is false.&nbsp; Then again the second inscription must be true. So the second box must contain the key, if the first inscription is true, and also if the first inscription is false.&nbsp; Therefore, the second box must logically contain the key."</p>
<p>The jester opened the second box, and found a dagger.</p>
<p>"How?!" cried the jester in horror, as he was dragged away.&nbsp; "It's logically impossible!"</p>
<p>"It is entirely possible," replied the king.&nbsp; "I merely wrote those inscriptions on two boxes, and then I put the dagger in the second one."</p>
