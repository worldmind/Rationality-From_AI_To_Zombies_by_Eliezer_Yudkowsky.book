<p>Sometimes I wonder if the Pythagoreans had the right idea.</p>
<p>Yes, I've <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/in/scientific_evidence_legal_evidence_rational/">written</a> about how "science" is inherently public.&nbsp; I've written that "science" is distinguished from merely rational knowledge by the in-principle ability to reproduce scientific experiments for yourself, to know without relying on authority.&nbsp; I've said that "science" should be defined as the publicly accessible knowledge of humankind.&nbsp; I've even suggested that future generations will regard all papers not published in an open-access journal as non-science, i.e., it can't be part of the public knowledge of humankind if you make people pay to read it.</p>
<p>But that's only one vision of the future.&nbsp; In another vision, the knowledge we now call "science" is taken <em>out</em> of the public domain&mdash;the books and journals hidden away, guarded by <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/md/cultish_countercultishness/">mystic cults</a> of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/m2/the_litany_against_gurus/">gurus</a> wearing <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/m4/two_cult_koans/">robes</a>, requiring fearsome initiation rituals for access&mdash;so that more people will <em>actually</em> study it.</p>
<p>I mean, right now, people <em>can</em> study science but they <em>don't.</em></p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/oz/scarcity/">Scarcity</a>", it's called in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=scarcity+psychology">social psychology</a>.&nbsp; What appears to be in limited supply, is more highly valued.&nbsp; And this effect is <em>especially</em> strong with information&mdash;we're much more likely to try to obtain information that we believe is secret, and to value it more when we do obtain it.</p>
<p>With science, I think, people assume that if the information is freely available, it must not be important.&nbsp; So instead people join cults that have the sense to keep their Great Truths secret.&nbsp; The Great Truth may actually be gibberish, but it's more satisfying than coherent science, because it's <em>secret.</em></p>
<p>Science is the great Purloined Letter of our times, left out in the open and ignored.</p>
<p>Sure, scientific openness helps the scientific elite.&nbsp; They've already <em>been</em> through the initiation rituals.&nbsp; But for the rest of the planet, science is kept secret a hundred times more effectively by making it freely available, than if its books were guarded in vaults and you had to walk over hot coals to get access.&nbsp; (This being a fearsome trial indeed, since the great secrets of insulation are only available to Physicist-Initiates of the Third Level.)</p>
<p>If scientific knowledge were hidden in ancient vaults (rather than hidden in inconvenient pay-for-access journals), at least then people would <em>try</em> to get into the vaults.&nbsp; They'd be <em>desperate</em> to learn science.&nbsp; Especially when they saw the power that Eighth Level Physicists could wield, and were told that they <em>weren't allowed to know</em> the explanation.</p>
<p>And if you tried to start a cult around oh, say, Scientology, you'd get some degree of public interest, at first.&nbsp; But people would very quickly start asking uncomfortable questions like "Why haven't you given a public demonstration of your Eighth Level powers, like the Physicists?" and "How come none of the Master Mathematicians seem to want to join your cult?" and "Why should I follow your Founder when he isn't an Eighth Level anything outside his own cult?" and "Why should I study <em>your</em> cult <em>first,</em> when the Dentists of Doom can do things that are so much more impressive?"</p>
<p>When you look at it from that perspective, the escape of math from the Pythagorean cult starts to look like a major strategic blunder for humanity.</p>
<p>Now, I know what you're going to say:&nbsp; "But science <em>is</em> surrounded by fearsome initiation rituals!&nbsp; Plus it's <em>inherently</em> difficult to learn!&nbsp; Why doesn't <em>that</em> count?"&nbsp; Because the public <em>thinks</em> that science is freely available, that's why.&nbsp; If you're <em>allowed</em> to learn, it must not be important enough <em>to</em> learn.</p>
<p>It's an image problem, people taking their cues from others' attitudes.&nbsp; Just <em>anyone</em> can walk into the supermarket and buy a light bulb, and nobody looks at it with awe and reverence.&nbsp; The physics supposedly aren't secret (even though <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/os/joy_in_discovery/"><em>you</em> don't know</a>), and there's a one-paragraph <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ip/fake_explanations/">explanation</a> in the newspaper that sounds vaguely authoritative and convincing&mdash;essentially, no one treats the lightbulb as a sacred mystery, so neither do you.</p>
<p>Even the simplest little things, completely inert objects like crucifixes, can become magical if everyone <em>looks</em> at them like they're magic.&nbsp; But since you're theoretically <em>allowed</em> to know why the light bulb works without climbing the mountain to find the remote Monastery of Electricians, there's no need to <em>actually</em> bother to learn.</p>
<p>Now, because science does in fact have initiation rituals both social and cognitive, scientists are not wholly dissatisfied with their science.&nbsp; The problem is that, in the present world, very few people bother to study science in the first place.&nbsp; Science cannot be the true Secret Knowledge, because just anyone is allowed to know it&mdash;<em>even though, in fact, they don't</em>.</p>
<p>If the Great Secret of Natural Selection, passed down from Darwin Who Is Not Forgotten, was only ever imparted to you after you paid $2000 and went through a ceremony involving torches and robes and masks and sacrificing an ox, <em>then </em>when you were shown the fossils, and shown <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/">the optic cable going through the retina</a> under a microscope, and finally told the Truth, you would say "That's the most brilliant thing ever!" and <em>be satisfied.</em>&nbsp; After that, if some other cult tried to tell you it was actually a bearded man in the sky 6000 years ago, you'd laugh like hell.</p>
<p>And you know, it might actually be more <em>fun</em> to do things that way.&nbsp; Especially if the initiation required you to put together some of the evidence for yourself&mdash;together, or with classmates&mdash;before you could tell your Science Sensei you were ready to advance to the next level.&nbsp; It wouldn't be <em>efficient,</em> sure, but it would be <em>fun.</em></p>
<p>If humanity had never made the mistake&mdash;never gone down the religious path, and never learned to fear anything that smacks of religion&mdash;then maybe the Ph.D. granting ceremony would involve litanies and chanting, because, hey, that's what people like.&nbsp; Why take the fun out of everything?</p>
<p>Maybe we're just doing it wrong.</p>
<p>And no, I'm not <em>seriously</em> proposing that we try to reverse the last five hundred years of openness and classify all the science secret.&nbsp; At least, not at the moment.&nbsp; Efficiency is important for now, especially in things like medical research.&nbsp; I'm just explaining why it is that I won't tell anyone the Secret of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/og/wrong_questions/">how the ineffable difference between blueness and redness arises from mere atoms</a> for less than $100,000&mdash;</p>
<p>Ahem!&nbsp; I meant to say, I'm telling you about this vision of an alternate Earth, so that you give science equal treatment with cults.&nbsp; So that you don't undervalue scientific truth when you learn it, <em>just</em> because it doesn't seem to be protected appropriately to its value.&nbsp; <em>Imagine</em> the robes and masks.&nbsp; Visualize yourself creeping into the vaults and stealing the Lost Knowledge of Newton.&nbsp; And don't be fooled by any organization that <em>does</em> use robes and masks, unless they also show you the data.</p>
<p>People seem to have <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/oy/is_humanism_a_religionsubstitute/">holes in their minds</a> for Esoteric Knowledge, Deep Secrets, the Hidden Truth.&nbsp; And I'm not even criticizing this psychology!&nbsp; There <em>are</em> deep secret esoteric hidden truths, like quantum mechanics or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o7/searching_for_bayesstructure/">Bayes-structure</a>.&nbsp; We've just gotten into the habit of presenting the Hidden Truth in a very <em>unsatisfying</em> way, wrapped up in false mundanity.</p>
<p>But if the holes for secret knowledge are not filled by true beliefs, they will be filled by false beliefs.&nbsp; There is <em>nothing but</em> science to learn&mdash;the emotional energy must either be <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ot/bind_yourself_to_reality/">invested in reality</a>, or wasted in total nonsense, or destroyed.&nbsp; For myself, I think it is better to invest the emotional energy; fun should not be needlessly cast away.</p>
<p>Right now, we've got the worst of both worlds.&nbsp; Science isn't <em>really</em> free, because the courses are expensive and the textbooks are expensive.&nbsp; But the public <em>thinks</em> that anyone is allowed to know, so it must not be important.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would want to arrange things the other way around.</p>
