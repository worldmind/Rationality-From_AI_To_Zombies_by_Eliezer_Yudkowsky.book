<p>You've got to admire that phrase, "dull catalogue of common things".&nbsp; What is it, exactly, that goes in this catalogue?&nbsp; Besides rainbows, that is?</p>
<p>Why, things that are mundane, of course.&nbsp; Things that are normal; things that are unmagical; things that are known, or knowable; things that play by the rules (or that play by <em>any</em> rules, which makes them boring); things that are part of the ordinary universe; things that are, in a word, <em>real.</em></p>
<p>Now that's what I call setting yourself up for a fall.</p>
<p>At that rate, sooner or later you're going to be disappointed in <em>everything</em>&mdash;either it will turn out not to exist, or even worse, it will turn out to be real.</p>
<p>If we cannot take joy in things that are merely real, our lives will <em>always</em> be empty.</p>

<p>For what sin are rainbows demoted to the dull catalogue of common things?&nbsp; For the sin of having a scientific explanation.&nbsp; "We know her woof, her texture", says Keats&mdash;an interesting use of the word "we", because I <a href="/lw/op/fake_reductionism/">suspect that Keats didn't know</a> the explanation himself.&nbsp; I suspect that just being <a href="/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/">told that someone else knew</a> was too much for him to take.&nbsp; I suspect that just the notion of rainbows being scientifically explicable <em>in principle</em> would have been too much to take.&nbsp; And if Keats didn't think like that, well, I know plenty of people who do.</p>
<p>I have already remarked that nothing is <em>inherently</em> <a href="/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/">mysterious</a>&mdash;nothing that actually exists, that is.&nbsp; If I am <a href="/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/">ignorant</a> about a phenomenon, that is <a href="/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/">a fact about my state of mind</a>, not a fact about the phenomenon; to <a href="/lw/j2/explainworshipignore/">worship</a> a phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully mysterious, is to worship your own ignorance; a blank map does not correspond to a blank territory, it is just somewhere we haven't visited yet, etc. etc...</p>
<p>Which is to say that <em>everything</em>&mdash;everything that <em>actually </em>exists&mdash;is liable to end up in "the dull catalogue of common things", sooner or later.</p>
<p>Your choice is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide that things are allowed to be unmagical, knowable, scientifically explicable, in a word, <em>real,</em> and yet still worth caring about;</li>
<li>Or go about the rest of your life suffering from existential ennui that is <em>unresolvable.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>(Self-deception might be an option for others, but <a href="/lw/je/doublethink_choosing_to_be_biased/">not for you</a>.)</p>
<p>This puts quite a different complexion on the bizarre habit indulged by those strange folk called <em>scientists,</em> wherein they suddenly become fascinated by pocket lint or bird droppings or rainbows, or some other ordinary thing which world-weary and sophisticated folk would never give a second glance.</p>
<p>You might say that scientists&mdash;at least <em>some </em>scientists&mdash;are those folk who are <em>in principle</em> capable of enjoying life in the real universe.</p>
