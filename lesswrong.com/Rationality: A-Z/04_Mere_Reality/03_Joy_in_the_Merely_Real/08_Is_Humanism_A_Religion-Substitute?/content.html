<p>For many years before the Wright Brothers, people dreamed of flying with magic potions.&nbsp; There was <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ot/bind_yourself_to_reality/">nothing irrational</a> about the <em>raw desire</em> to fly.&nbsp; There was nothing <em>tainted</em> about the wish to look down on a cloud from above.&nbsp; Only the "magic potions" part was irrational.</p>
<p>Suppose you were to put me into an fMRI scanner, and take a movie of my brain's activity levels, while I watched a space shuttle launch.&nbsp; (Wanting to visit space is not "realistic", but it is an essentially lawful dream&mdash;one that can be fulfilled in a lawful universe.)&nbsp; The fMRI might&mdash;maybe, maybe not&mdash;resemble the fMRI of a devout Christian watching a nativity scene.</p>
<p>Should an experimenter obtain this result, there's a lot of people out there, both Christians and some atheists, who would gloat:&nbsp; "Ha, ha, space travel is your <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/lo/uncritical_supercriticality/">religion</a>!"</p>
<p>But that's drawing the wrong <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o2/mutual_information_and_density_in_thingspace/">category</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o3/superexponential_conceptspace_and_simple_words/">boundary</a>.&nbsp; It's like saying that, because some people once tried to fly by irrational means, no one should ever enjoy looking out of an airplane window on the clouds below.</p>

<p>If a rocket launch is what it takes to give me a feeling of aesthetic transcendence, I do not see this as a <em>substitute </em>for religion.&nbsp; That is theomorphism&mdash;the viewpoint from gloating religionists who assume that everyone who <em>isn't</em> religious has a hole in their mind that wants filling.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair to the religionists, this is not <em>just </em>a gloating assumption.&nbsp; There <em>are</em> atheists who have religion-shaped holes in their minds.&nbsp; I <em>have </em>seen attempts to substitute atheism or even transhumanism for religion.&nbsp; And the result is invariably awful.&nbsp; Utterly awful.&nbsp; Absolutely abjectly awful.</p>
<p>I call such efforts, "hymns to the nonexistence of God".</p>
<p>When someone sets out to write an atheistic hymn&mdash;"Hail, oh unintelligent universe," blah, blah, blah&mdash;the result will, without exception, suck.</p>
<p>Why?&nbsp; Because they're being <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/">imitative.</a>&nbsp; Because they have no motivation for writing the hymn <em>except</em> a vague feeling that since churches have hymns, they ought to have one too.&nbsp; And, on a purely artistic level, that puts them far beneath genuine religious art that is not an imitation of anything, but an original expression of emotion.</p>
<p>Religious hymns were (often) written by people who <em>felt strongly</em> and<em> wrote honestly</em> and put serious effort into the prosody and imagery of their work&mdash;that's what gives their work the grace that it possesses, of artistic integrity.</p>
<p>So are atheists doomed to hymnlessness?</p>
<p>There is an acid test of attempts at post-theism.&nbsp; The acid test is:&nbsp; "If religion had never existed among the human species&mdash;if we had <em>never made</em> the original mistake&mdash;would this song, this art, this ritual, this way of thinking, still make sense?"</p>
<p>If humanity had never made the original mistake, there would be no hymns to the nonexistence of God.&nbsp; But there would still be marriages, so the notion of an atheistic marriage ceremony makes perfect sense&mdash;as long as you don't suddenly launch into a lecture on how God doesn't exist.&nbsp; Because, in a world where religion <em>never had</em> existed, nobody would interrupt a wedding to talk about the implausibility of a distant hypothetical concept.&nbsp; They'd talk about love, children, commitment, honesty, devotion, but who the heck would mention God?</p>
<p>And, in a human world where religion <em>never had</em> existed, there would still be people who got tears in their eyes watching a space shuttle launch.</p>
<p>Which is why, even if experiment shows that watching a shuttle launch makes "religion"-associated areas of my brain light up, associated with feelings of transcendence, I do not see that as a <em>substitute</em> for religion; I expect the same brain areas would light up, for the same reason, if I lived in a world where religion had never been invented.</p>
<p>A good "atheistic hymn" is simply a song about anything worth singing about that doesn't happen to be religious.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/lw/reversed_stupidity_is_not_intelligence/">reversed stupidity is not intelligence</a>.&nbsp; The world's greatest idiot may say the Sun is shining, but that doesn't make it dark out.&nbsp; The point is <em>not</em> to create a life that resembles religion as little as possible in every surface aspect&mdash;this is the same kind of thinking that inspires hymns to the nonexistence of God.&nbsp; If humanity had never made the original mistake, no one would be <em>trying to avoid</em> things that vaguely resembled religion.&nbsp; Believe accurately, then <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hp/feeling_rational/">feel accordingly</a>:&nbsp; If space launches actually exist, and watching a rocket rise makes you want to sing, then write the song, dammit.</p>
<p>If I get tears in my eyes at a space shuttle launch, it doesn't mean I'm trying to fill a hole left by religion&mdash;it means that my emotional energies, my <em>caring,</em> are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ot/bind_yourself_to_reality/">bound into the real world</a>.</p>
<p>If God did speak plainly, and answer prayers reliably, God would just become one more boringly real thing, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/">no more worth believing in than the postman</a>.&nbsp; If God were real, it would destroy the inner uncertainty that brings forth outward fervor in compensation.&nbsp; And if everyone else believed God were real, it would destroy the specialness of being one of the elect.</p>
<p>If you invest your emotional energy in space travel, you don't have those vulnerabilities.&nbsp; I can <em>see</em> the Space Shuttle rise without losing the awe.&nbsp; Everyone else can believe that Space Shuttles are real, and it doesn't make them any less special.&nbsp; I haven't painted myself into the corner.</p>
<p>The choice between God and humanity is not just a choice of drugs.&nbsp; Above all, humanity <em>actually exists.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
