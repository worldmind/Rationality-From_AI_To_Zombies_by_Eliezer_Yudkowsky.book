<p>Once upon a time, I was pondering the philosophy of fantasy stories&mdash;</p>
<p>And before anyone chides me for my "failure to understand what fantasy is about", let me say this:&nbsp; I was raised in an SF&amp;F household.&nbsp; I have been reading fantasy stories since I was five years old.&nbsp; I occasionally try to <em>write</em> fantasy <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction">stories</a>.&nbsp; And I am <em>not</em> the sort of person who tries to write for a genre without pondering its philosophy.&nbsp; Where do you think story ideas come from?</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p>I was pondering the philosophy of fantasy stories, and it occurred to me that if there were actually dragons in our world&mdash;if you could go down to the zoo, or even to a distant mountain, and meet a fire-breathing dragon&mdash;while nobody had ever actually seen a zebra, then our fantasy stories would contain zebras aplenty, while dragons would be unexciting.</p>
<p>Now that's what I call painting yourself into a corner, wot?&nbsp; The grass is always greener on the other side of unreality.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>In one of the standard fantasy plots, a protagonist from our Earth, a sympathetic character with lousy grades or a crushing mortgage but still a good heart, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hq/universal_fire/">suddenly finds themselves in a world</a> where magic operates in place of science.&nbsp; The protagonist often goes on to practice magic, and become in due course a (superpowerful) sorcerer.</p>
<p>Now here's the question&mdash;and yes, it is a little unkind, but I think it needs to be asked:&nbsp; Presumably most readers of these novels see themselves in the protagonist's shoes, fantasizing about their own acquisition of sorcery.&nbsp; Wishing for magic.&nbsp; And, barring improbable demographics, most readers of these novels are not scientists.</p>
<p>Born into a world of science, they did not become scientists.&nbsp; What makes them think that, in a world of magic, they would act any differently?</p>
<p>If they don't have the scientific attitude, that <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/or/joy_in_the_merely_real/">nothing is "mere"</a>&mdash;the capacity to be interested in merely real things&mdash;how will magic help them?&nbsp; If they actually <em>had</em> magic, it would be merely <em>real,</em> and lose the charm of unattainability.&nbsp; They might be excited at first, but (like the lottery winners who, six months later, aren't nearly as happy as they expected to be), the excitement would soon wear off.&nbsp; Probably as soon as they had to actually <em>study </em>spells.</p>
<p><em>Unless</em> they can find the capacity to take joy in things that are merely real.&nbsp; To be just as excited by hang-gliding, as riding a dragon; to be as excited by making a light with electricity, as by making a light with magic... even if it takes a little study...</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I'm not dissing dragons.&nbsp; Who knows, we might even create some, one of these days.</p>
<p>But if you don't have the capacity to enjoy hang-gliding even though it is <em>merely real</em>, then as soon as dragons <em>turn</em> real, you're not going to be any more excited by dragons than you are by hang-gliding.</p>
<p>Do you think you would prefer living in the Future, to living in the present?&nbsp; That's a quite understandable preference.&nbsp; Things do seem to be getting better over time.</p>
<p>But don't forget that <em>this is</em> the Future, relative to the Dark Ages of a thousand years earlier.&nbsp; You have opportunities undreamt-of even by kings.</p>
<p>If the trend continues, the Future might be a very fine place indeed in which to live.&nbsp; But if you do make it to the Future, what you find, when you get there, will be another Now.&nbsp; If you don't have the basic capacity to enjoy being in a Now&mdash;if your emotional energy can <em>only</em> go into the Future, if you can <em>only </em>hope for a better tomorrow&mdash;then no amount of passing time can help you.</p>
<p>(Yes, in the Future there could be a pill that fixes the emotional problem of always looking to the Future.&nbsp; I don't think this invalidates my basic point, which is about what sort of pills we should want to take.)</p>
<p>Matthew C., <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/on/reductionism/irh">commenting here on LW</a>, seems very excited about an informally specified "theory" by Rupert Sheldrake which "<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/is/fake_causality/">explains</a>" such non-explanation-demanding phenomena as protein folding and snowflake symmetry.&nbsp; But why isn't Matthew C. just as excited about, say, Special Relativity?&nbsp; Special Relativity is actually <em>known</em> to be a law, so why isn't it even <em>more</em> exciting?&nbsp; The advantage of becoming excited about a law already known to be true, is that you know your excitement will not be wasted.</p>
<p>If Sheldrake's theory were accepted truth taught in elementary schools, Matthew C. wouldn't care about it.&nbsp; Or why else is Matthew C. fascinated by that one particular law which he believes to be a law of physics, more than all the other laws?</p>
<p>The worst catastrophe you could visit upon the New Age community would be for their rituals to start working reliably, and for UFOs to actually appear in the skies.&nbsp; What would be the point of believing in aliens, if they were just <em>there,</em> and everyone else could see them too?&nbsp; In a world where psychic powers were merely real, New Agers wouldn't <em>believe in</em> psychic powers, any more than anyone cares enough about gravity to believe in it.&nbsp; (Except for scientists, of course.)</p>
<p>Why am I so negative about magic?&nbsp; Would it be <em>wrong</em> for magic to exist?</p>
<p>I'm not actually negative on magic.&nbsp; Remember, I occasionally try to write fantasy stories.&nbsp; But I'm annoyed with this psychology that, if it were born into a world where spells and potions did work, would pine away for a world where household goods were abundantly produced by assembly lines.</p>
<p>Part of binding yourself to reality, on an emotional as well as intellectual level, is coming to terms with the fact that you <em>do live here.</em>&nbsp; Only then can you see this, your world, and whatever opportunities it holds out for you, without wishing your sight away.</p>
<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but<em> I've</em> found no lack of dragons to fight, or magics to master, in this world of my birth.&nbsp; If I were transported into one of those fantasy novels, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself studying the forbidden ultimate sorcery&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;because why should being transported into a magical world change anything?&nbsp; It's not <em>where</em> you are, it's <em>who</em> you are.</p>
<p>So remember the Litany Against Being Transported Into An Alternate Universe:</p>
<p>If I'm going to be happy anywhere,<br />Or achieve greatness anywhere,<br />Or learn true secrets anywhere,<br /> Or save the world anywhere,<br />Or feel strongly anywhere,<br />Or help people anywhere,<br />I may as well do it in reality.</p>
