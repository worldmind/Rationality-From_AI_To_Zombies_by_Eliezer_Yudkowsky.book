<p>RI, you've got no idea how glad I was to see you post that comment.</p>
<p>Of course I had more than just <em>one</em> reason for spending all that time posting about quantum physics.&nbsp; I like having lots of hidden motives, it's the closest I can ethically get to being a supervillain.</p>
<p>But to give an example of a purpose I could <em>only</em> accomplish by discussing quantum physics...</p>
<p>In physics, you can get absolutely clear-cut issues.&nbsp; Not in the sense that the issues are trivial to explain.&nbsp; But if you try to apply Bayes to healthcare, or economics, you may not be able to <em>formally</em> lay out what is the simplest hypothesis, or what the evidence supports.&nbsp; But when I say "macroscopic decoherence is simpler than collapse" it is actually <em>strict</em> simplicity; you could write the two hypotheses out as computer programs and count the lines of code. Nor is the evidence itself in dispute.</p>
<p>I wanted a very clear example&mdash;<em>Bayes says "zig", this is a zag</em>&mdash;when it came time to break your allegiance to Science.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>"Oh, sure," you say, "the physicists messed up the many-worlds thing, but give them a break, Eliezer!&nbsp; No one ever claimed that the social process of science was perfect.&nbsp; People are human; they make mistakes."</p>
<p>But the physicists who refuse to adopt many-worlds aren't disobeying the rules of Science.&nbsp; They're <em>obeying</em> the rules of Science.</p>
<p>The tradition handed down through the generations says that a new physics theory comes up with new experimental predictions that distinguish it from the old theory.&nbsp; You perform the test, and the new theory is confirmed or falsified.&nbsp; If it's confirmed, you hold a huge celebration, call the newspapers, and hand out Nobel Prizes for everyone; any doddering old emeritus professors who refuse to convert are quietly humored.&nbsp; If the theory is disconfirmed, the lead proponent publicly recants, and gains a reputation for honesty.</p>
<p>This is not how things <em>do </em>work in science; rather it is how things are <em>supposed</em> to work in Science.&nbsp; It's the ideal to which all good scientists aspire.</p>
<p>Now many-worlds comes along, and it doesn't seem to make any new predictions relative to the old theory.&nbsp; That's suspicious.&nbsp; And there's all these other worlds, but you can't see them.&nbsp; That's <em>really </em>suspicious.&nbsp; It just doesn't seem scientific.</p>
<p>If you got as far as RI&mdash;so that many-worlds now seems perfectly logical, obvious and normal&mdash;<em>and</em> you also started out as a Traditional Rationalist, then you should be able to switch back and forth between the Scientific view and the Bayesian view, like a Necker Cube.</p>
<p>So now put on your Science Goggles&mdash;you've still got them around somewhere, right?&nbsp; Forget everything you know about Kolmogorov complexity, Solomonoff induction or Minimum Message Lengths.&nbsp; That's not part of the traditional training.&nbsp; You just eyeball something to see how "simple" it looks.&nbsp; The word "testable" doesn't conjure up a mental image of Bayes's Theorem governing probability flows; it conjures up a mental image of being in a lab, performing an experiment, and having the celebration (or public recantation) afterward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Science-Goggles on</em>:&nbsp; The current quantum theory has passed all experimental tests so far.&nbsp; Many-Worlds doesn't make any new testable predictions&mdash;the amazing new phenomena it predicts are all hidden away where we can't see them.&nbsp; You can get along fine without supposing the other worlds, and that's just what you should do.&nbsp; The whole thing smacks of science fiction.&nbsp; But it must be admitted that quantum physics is a very deep and very confusing issue, and who knows what discoveries might be in store?&nbsp; Call me when Many-Worlds makes a testable prediction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Science-Goggles off, Bayes-Goggles back on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bayes-Goggles on</em>:&nbsp; The simplest quantum equations that cover all known evidence don't have a special exception for human-sized masses.&nbsp; There isn't even any reason to ask that particular question.&nbsp; Next!</p>

<p>Okay, so is this a problem we can fix in five minutes with some duct tape and superglue?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Huh?&nbsp; Why not just teach new graduating classes of scientists about Solomonoff induction and Bayes's Rule?</p>
<p>Centuries ago, there was a widespread idea that the Wise could unravel the secrets of the universe just by thinking about them, while to go out and <em>look</em> at things was lesser, inferior, naive, and would just delude you in the end.&nbsp; You couldn't trust the way things <em>looked</em>&mdash;only thought could be your guide.</p>
<p>Science began as a rebellion against this Deep Wisdom.&nbsp; At the core is the pragmatic belief that human beings, sitting around in their armchairs trying to be Deeply Wise, just drift off into never-never land.&nbsp; You couldn't trust your thoughts.&nbsp; You had to make advance experimental predictions&mdash;predictions that no one else had made before&mdash;run the test, and confirm the result.&nbsp; That was evidence.&nbsp; Sitting in your armchair, thinking about what seemed reasonable... would not be taken to <em>prejudice</em> your theory, because Science wasn't an idealistic belief about pragmatism, or getting your hands dirty.&nbsp; It was, rather, the dictum that experiment alone would decide.&nbsp; Only experiments could judge your theory&mdash;not your nationality, or your religious professions, or the fact that you'd invented the theory in your armchair.&nbsp; Only experiments!&nbsp; If you sat in your armchair and came up with a theory that made a novel prediction, and experiment confirmed the prediction, then we would care about the result of the experiment, not where your hypothesis came from.</p>
<p><em>That's</em> Science.&nbsp; And if you say that Many-Worlds should replace the immensely successful Copenhagen Interpretation, adding on all these twin Earths that can't be observed, just because it <em>sounds more reasonable and elegant</em>&mdash;not because it <em>crushed the old theory with a superior experimental prediction</em>&mdash;then you're undoing the core scientific rule that prevents people from running out and putting angels into all the theories, because angels are more reasonable and elegant.</p>
<p>You think teaching a few people about Solomonoff induction is going to solve <em>that</em> problem?&nbsp; Nobel laureate Robert Aumann&mdash;who first proved that Bayesian agents with similar priors cannot agree to disagree&mdash;is a believing Orthodox Jew.&nbsp; Aumann helped a project to test the Torah for "Bible codes", hidden prophecies from God&mdash;and concluded that the project had failed to confirm the codes' existence.&nbsp; Do you want Aumann thinking that once you've got Solomonoff induction, you can forget about the experimental method?&nbsp; Do you think that's going to help him?&nbsp; And most scientists out there will not rise to the level of Robert Aumann.</p>
<p>Okay, Bayes-Goggles back on.&nbsp; Are you <em>really</em> going to believe that large parts of the wavefunction disappear when you can no longer see them?&nbsp; As a result of the only non-linear non-unitary non-differentiable non-CPT-symmetric acausal faster-than-light informally-specified phenomenon in all of physics?&nbsp; Just because, by sheer historical contingency, the stupid version of the theory was proposed first?</p>
<p>Are you going to make a major modification to a scientific model, and believe in zillions of other worlds you can't see, without a defining moment of experimental triumph over the old model?</p>
<p>Or are you going to reject probability theory?</p>
<p>Will you give your allegiance to Science, or to Bayes?</p>
<p>Michael Vassar once observed (tongue-in-cheek) that it was a good thing that a majority of the human species believed in God, because otherwise, he would have a very hard time rejecting <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/03/on_majoritarian.html">majoritarianism</a>. But since the majority opinion that God exists is simply unbelievable, we have no choice but to reject the extremely strong philosophical arguments for majoritarianism.</p>
<p>You can see (one of the reasons) why I went to such lengths to explain quantum theory.&nbsp; Those who are good at math should now be able to <em>visualize</em> both <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/pu/on_being_decoherent/">macroscopic decoherence</a>, and the probability theory of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/q3/decoherence_is_simple/">simplicity and testability</a>&mdash;get the insanity of a global single world on a <em>gut</em> level.</p>
<p>I wanted to present you with a nice, sharp dilemma between rejecting the scientific method, or embracing insanity.</p>
<p>Why?&nbsp; I'll give you a hint:&nbsp; It's not just because I'm evil.&nbsp; If you would guess my motives here, think beyond the first obvious answer.</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; If you try to come up with clever ways to wriggle out of the dilemma, you're just going to get shot down in future posts.&nbsp; You have been warned.</p>
