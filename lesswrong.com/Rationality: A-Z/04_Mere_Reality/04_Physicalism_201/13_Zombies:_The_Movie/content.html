<p>FADE IN around a serious-looking group of uniformed military officers.&nbsp; At the head of the table, a senior, heavy-set man, GENERAL FRED, speaks.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; The reports are confirmed.&nbsp; New York has been overrun... by <em>zombies</em>.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; Again?&nbsp; But we just had a zombie invasion 28 days ago!</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; These zombies... are different.&nbsp; They're... <em>philosophical</em> zombies.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&nbsp; Are they filled with rage, causing them to bite people?</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; Do they lose all capacity for reason?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; They behave... <em>exactly</em> like we do... except that they're not conscious.</p>
<p>(<em>Silence grips the table.</em>)</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; Dear God.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>GENERAL FRED moves over to a computerized display.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; This is New York City, two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The display shows crowds bustling through the streets, people eating in restaurants, a garbage truck hauling away trash.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; <em>This...</em> is New York City... <em>now.</em></p>
<p>The display changes, showing a crowded subway train, a group of students laughing in a park, and a couple holding hands in the sunlight.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; It's worse than I imagined.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&nbsp; How can you tell, exactly?</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; I've never seen anything so brutally ordinary.</p>
<p>A lab-coated SCIENTIST stands up at the foot of the table.</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&nbsp; The zombie disease eliminates consciousness without changing the brain in any way.&nbsp; We've been trying to understand how the disease is transmitted.&nbsp; Our conclusion is that, since the disease attacks dual properties of ordinary matter, it must, itself, operate outside our universe.&nbsp; We're dealing with an <em>epiphenomenal virus</em>.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; Are you sure?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&nbsp; As sure as we can be in the total absence of evidence.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Compile a report on every epiphenomenon ever observed.&nbsp; What, where, and who.&nbsp; I want a list of everything that hasn't happened in the last fifty years.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&nbsp; If the virus is epiphenomenal, how do we know it exists?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&nbsp; The same way we know <em>we're</em> conscious.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&nbsp; Oh, okay.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; Have the doctors made any progress on finding an epiphenomenal cure?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&nbsp; They've tried every placebo in the book.&nbsp; No dice.&nbsp; Everything they do has an effect.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; Have you brought in a homeopath?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&nbsp; I tried, sir!&nbsp; I couldn't find any!</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; Excellent.&nbsp; And the Taoists?</p>
<p>SCIENTIST:&nbsp; They refuse to do anything!</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; Then we may yet be saved.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; What about David Chalmers?&nbsp; Shouldn't he be here?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; Chalmers... was one of the first victims.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; Oh no.</p>
<p>(<em>Cut</em> to the INTERIOR of a cell, completely walled in by reinforced glass, where DAVID CHALMERS paces back and forth.)</p>
<p>DOCTOR:&nbsp; David!&nbsp; David Chalmers!&nbsp; Can you hear me?</p>
<p>CHALMERS:&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>NURSE:&nbsp; It's no use, doctor.</p>
<p>CHALMERS:&nbsp; I'm perfectly fine.&nbsp; I've been introspecting on my consciousness, and I can't detect any difference.&nbsp; I <em>know</em> I would be expected to say that, but&mdash;</p>
<p>The DOCTOR turns away from the glass screen in horror.</p>
<p>DOCTOR:&nbsp; His words, they... they <em>don't mean anything.</em></p>
<p>CHALMERS:&nbsp; This is a grotesque distortion of my philosophical views.&nbsp; This sort of thing can't actually happen!</p>
<p>DOCTOR:&nbsp; Why not?</p>
<p>NURSE:&nbsp; Yes, why not?</p>
<p>CHALMERS:&nbsp; Because&mdash;</p>
<p>(<em>Cut</em> to two POLICE OFFICERS, guarding a dirt road leading up to the imposing steel gate of a gigantic concrete complex.&nbsp; On their uniforms, a badge reads "BRIDGING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY".)</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&nbsp; You've got to watch out for those clever bastards.&nbsp; They look like humans.&nbsp; They can talk like humans.&nbsp; They're identical to humans on the atomic level.&nbsp; But they're not human.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&nbsp; Scumbags.</p>
<p>The huge noise of a throbbing engine echoes over the hills.&nbsp; Up rides the MAN on a white motorcycle.&nbsp; The MAN is wearing black sunglasses and a black leather business suit with a black leather tie and silver metal boots.&nbsp; His white beard flows in the wind.&nbsp; He pulls to a halt in front of the gate.</p>
<p>The OFFICERS bustle up to the motorcycle.</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&nbsp; State your business here.</p>
<p>MAN:&nbsp; Is this where you're keeping David Chalmers?</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&nbsp; What's it to you?&nbsp; You a friend of his?</p>
<p>MAN:&nbsp; Can't say I am.&nbsp; But even zombies have rights.</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&nbsp; All right, buddy, let's see your qualia.</p>
<p>MAN:&nbsp; I don't have any.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2 suddenly pulls a gun, keeping it trained on the MAN.&nbsp; OFFICER 2:&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp; A zombie!</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&nbsp; No, zombies claim to have qualia.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&nbsp; So he's an ordinary human?</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&nbsp; No, they also claim to have qualia.</p>
<p>The OFFICERS look at the MAN, who waits calmly.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&nbsp; Um...</p>
<p>OFFICER 1:&nbsp; Who <em>are</em> you?</p>
<p>MAN:&nbsp; I'm Daniel Dennett, bitches.</p>
<p>Seemingly from nowhere, DENNETT pulls a sword and slices OFFICER 2's gun in half with a steely noise.&nbsp; OFFICER 1 begins to reach for his own gun, but DENNETT is suddenly standing behind OFFICER 1 and chops with a fist, striking the junction of OFFICER 1's shoulder and neck.&nbsp; OFFICER 1 drops to the ground.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2 steps back, horrified.</p>
<p>OFFICER 2:&nbsp; That's not possible!&nbsp; How'd you do that?</p>
<p>DENNETT:&nbsp; I am one with my body.</p>
<p>DENNETT drops OFFICER 2 with another blow, and strides toward the gate.&nbsp; He looks up at the imposing concrete complex, and grips his sword tighter.</p>
<p>DENNETT <em>(quietly to himself)</em>:&nbsp; There is a spoon.</p>
<p>(<em>Cut</em> back to GENERAL FRED and the other military officials.)</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; I've just received the reports.&nbsp; We've lost Detroit.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&nbsp; I don't want to be the one to say "Good riddance", but&mdash;</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; Australia has been... <em>reduced to atoms.</em></p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; The epiphenomenal virus is spreading faster.&nbsp; Civilization itself threatens to dissolve into total normality.&nbsp; We could be looking at the middle of humanity.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&nbsp; Can we negotiate with the zombies?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; We've sent them messages.&nbsp; They sent only a single reply.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&nbsp; Which was...?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; It's on its way now.</p>
<p>An orderly brings in an envelope, and hands it to GENERAL FRED.</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED opens the envelope, takes out a single sheet of paper, and reads it.</p>
<p>Silence envelops the room.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN MUDD:&nbsp; What's it say?</p>
<p>GENERAL FRED:&nbsp; It says... that <em>we're</em> the ones with the virus.</p>
<p>(A silence falls.)</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD raises his hands and stares at them.</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; My God, it's true.&nbsp; It's true.&nbsp; I...</p>
<p>(A tear rolls down COLONEL TODD's cheek.)</p>
<p>COLONEL TODD:&nbsp; I don't feel anything.</p>
<p>The screen goes black.</p>
<p>The sound goes silent.</p>
<p>The movie continues exactly as before.</p>

<p>Only at a <em>combination </em>science fiction and open-source convention would it be possible to attend a session on knife-throwing, cry "In the name of Bayes, die!", throw the knife, and then have a fellow holding a wooden shield say, "Yes, but how do you determine the prior for where the knife hits?"</p>
