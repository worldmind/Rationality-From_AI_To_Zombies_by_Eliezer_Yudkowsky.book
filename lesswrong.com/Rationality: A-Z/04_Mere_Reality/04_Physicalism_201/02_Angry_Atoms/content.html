<p>Fundamental physics&mdash;quarks 'n stuff&mdash;is far removed from the levels we can <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/p2/hand_vs_fingers/"><em>see,</em></a> like hands and fingers.&nbsp; At best, you can know how to replicate the experiments which show that your hand (like everything else) is composed of quarks, and you may know how to derive a few equations for things like atoms and electron clouds and molecules.</p>
<p>At worst, the existence of quarks beneath your hand may just be something you were <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/">told</a>.&nbsp; In which case it's questionable in one what sense you can be said to "know" it at all, even if you repeat back the same word "quark" that a physicist would use to convey knowledge to another physicist.</p>
<p>Either way, you can't actually <em>see</em> the identity between levels&mdash;no one has a brain large enough to <em>visualize</em> avogadros of quarks and recognize a hand-pattern in them.</p>
<p>But we at least understand what hands <em>do.</em>&nbsp; Hands push on things, exert forces on them.&nbsp; When we're told about atoms, we visualize little billiard balls bumping into each other.&nbsp; This makes it seem obvious that "atoms" can push on things too, by bumping into them.</p>
<p>Now this notion of atoms is not quite correct.&nbsp; But so far as <em>human imagination</em> goes, it's relatively easy to imagine our hand being made up of a little galaxy of swirling billiard balls, pushing on things when our "fingers" touch them.&nbsp; Democritus imagined this 2400 years ago, and there was a time, roughly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom">1803-1922</a>, when Science thought he was right.</p>
<p>But what about, say, anger?</p>
<p>How could little billiard balls be angry?&nbsp; Tiny frowny faces on the billiard balls?</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>Put yourself in the shoes of, say, a hunter-gatherer&mdash;someone who may not even have a notion of writing, let alone the notion of using base matter to perform computations&mdash;someone who has no idea that such a thing as neurons exist.&nbsp; Then you can imagine the <em>functional</em> gap that your ancestors might have perceived between billiard balls and "Grrr!&nbsp; Aaarg!"</p>
<p>Forget about subjective experience for the moment, and consider the sheer <em>behavioral</em> gap between anger and billiard balls.&nbsp; The difference between what little billiard balls <em>do,</em> and what anger makes people <em>do.</em> Anger can make people raise their fists and hit someone&mdash;or say snide things behind their backs&mdash;or plant scorpions in their tents at night.&nbsp; Billiard balls just push on things.</p>
<p>Try to put yourself in the shoes of the hunter-gatherer who's never had the "Aha!" of information-processing.&nbsp; Try to avoid <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iz/failing_to_learn_from_history/">hindsight bias</a> about things like neurons and computers.&nbsp; Only then will you be able to see the uncrossable explanatory gap:</p>
<p>How can you explain angry behavior in terms of billiard balls?</p>
<p>Well, the <em>obvious</em> materialist conjecture is that the little billiard balls push on your arm and make you hit someone, or push on your tongue so that insults come out.</p>
<p>But how do the little billiard balls know how to do this&mdash;or how to guide your tongue and fingers through long-term plots&mdash;if they aren't angry themselves?</p>
<p>And besides, if you're not seduced by&mdash;gasp!&mdash;scientism, you can see from a first-person perspective that this explanation is obviously false.&nbsp; Atoms can push on your arm, but they can't make you <em>want</em> anything.</p>
<p>Someone may point out that drinking wine can make you angry.&nbsp; But who says that wine is made exclusively of little billiard balls?&nbsp; Maybe wine just contains a potency of angerness.</p>
<p>Clearly, reductionism is just a flawed notion.</p>
<p>(The novice goes astray and says "The art failed me"; the master goes astray and says "I failed my art.")</p>
<p>What does it take to cross this gap?&nbsp; It's not just the idea of "neurons" that "process information"&mdash;if you say only this and nothing more, it just inserts a magical, unexplained level-crossing rule into your model, where you go from billiards to thoughts.</p>
<p>But an Artificial Intelligence programmer who knows how to create a chess-playing program out of base matter, has taken a <em>genuine</em> step toward crossing the gap.&nbsp; If you understand concepts like <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/l4/terminal_values_and_instrumental_values/">consequentialism</a>, backward chaining, utility functions, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">search trees</a>, you can make merely causal/mechanical systems compute plans.</p>
<p>The trick goes something like this:&nbsp; For each possible chess move, compute the moves your opponent could make, then your responses to those moves, and so on; evaluate the furthest position you can see using some local algorithm (you might simply count up the material); then trace back using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax</a> to find the best move on the current board; then make that move.</p>
<p>More generally:&nbsp; If you have chains of causality inside the mind that have a kind of mapping&mdash;a mirror, an echo&mdash;to what goes on in the environment, then you can run a utility function over the end products of imagination, and find an action that achieves something which the utility function rates highly, and output that action.&nbsp; It is not necessary for the chains of causality inside the mind, that are similar to the environment, to be made out of billiard balls that have little auras of intentionality.&nbsp; Deep Blue's transistors do not need little chess pieces carved on them, in order to work.&nbsp; See also <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/truth.html">The Simple Truth</a>.</p>
<p>All this is still tremendously oversimplified, but it should, at least, reduce the apparent length of the gap.&nbsp; If you can understand all that, you can see how a planner built out of base matter can be influenced by alcohol to output more angry behaviors.&nbsp; The billiard balls in the alcohol push on the billiard balls making up the utility function.</p>
<p>But even if you know how to write small AIs, you can't <em>visualize</em> the level-crossing between transistors and chess.&nbsp; There are too many transistors, and too many moves to check.</p>
<p>Likewise, even if you knew all the facts of neurology, you would not be able to <em>visualize</em> the level-crossing between neurons and anger&mdash;let alone the level-crossing between atoms and anger.&nbsp; Not the way you can visualize a hand consisting of fingers, thumb, and palm.</p>
<p>And suppose a cognitive scientist just <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/op/fake_reductionism/">flatly tells</a> you "Anger is hormones"?&nbsp; Even if you repeat back the words, it doesn't mean you've crossed the gap.&nbsp; You may <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/">believe you believe it</a>, but that's not the same as understanding what little billiard balls have to do with wanting to hit someone.</p>
<p>So you come up with interpretations like, "Anger is <em>mere</em> hormones, it's caused by little molecules, so it must not be justified in any moral sense&mdash;<em>that's</em> why you should learn to control your anger."</p>
<p>Or, "There isn't really any such thing as anger&mdash;it's an illusion, a quotation with no referent, like a mirage of water in the desert, or looking in the garage for a dragon and not finding one."</p>
<p>These are both tough pills to swallow (not that you <em>should</em> swallow them) and so it is a good easier to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ir/science_as_attire/">profess</a> them than to believe them.</p>
<p>I think this is what non-reductionists/non-materialists think they are criticizing when they criticize reductive materialism.</p>
<p>But materialism isn't that easy.&nbsp; It's not as cheap as saying, "Anger is made out of atoms&mdash;there, now I'm done."&nbsp; That wouldn't explain how to get from billiard balls to hitting.&nbsp; You need the specific insights of computation, consequentialism, and search trees before you can start to close the explanatory gap.</p>
<p>All this was a relatively easy example <em>by modern standards,</em> because I restricted myself to talking about angry <em>behaviors.</em>&nbsp; Talking about outputs doesn't require you to appreciate <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/">how an algorithm feels from inside</a> (cross a first-person/third-person gap) or <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/og/wrong_questions/">dissolve a wrong question</a> (untangle places where the interior of your own mind runs skew to reality).</p>
<p>Going from material substances that bend and break, burn and fall, push and shove, to angry <em>behavior,</em> is just a practice problem by the standards of modern philosophy.&nbsp; But it is an <em>important</em> practice problem.&nbsp; It can only be fully appreciated, if you realize how <em>hard</em> it would have been to solve before writing was invented.&nbsp; There was once an explanatory gap here&mdash;though it may not seem that way in <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iz/failing_to_learn_from_history/">hindsight</a>, now that it's been bridged for generations.</p>
<p>Explanatory gaps can be crossed, if you accept help from science, and don't trust the view from the interior of your own mind.</p>
