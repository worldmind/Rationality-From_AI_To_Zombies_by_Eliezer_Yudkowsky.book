<p dragover="true">We have seen that knowledge implies <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o2/mutual_information_and_density_in_thingspace/">mutual information</a> between a mind and its environment, and we have seen that this <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o5/the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_and_engines_of/">mutual information is negentropy</a>
in a very physical sense:&nbsp; If you know where molecules are and how fast
they're moving, you can turn heat into work via a Maxwell's Demon /
Szilard engine.</p>

<p>We have seen that <a dragover="true" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o6/perpetual_motion_beliefs/">forming true beliefs without evidence</a>
is the same sort of improbability as a hot glass of water spontaneously
reorganizing into ice cubes and electricity.&nbsp; Rationality takes &quot;work&quot;
in a thermodynamic sense, not just the sense of mental effort; minds
have to radiate heat if they are not perfectly efficient.&nbsp; This
cognitive work is governed by probability theory, of which
thermodynamics is a special case.&nbsp; (Statistical mechanics is a special
case of statistics.)</p>

<p>If you saw a machine continually spinning a wheel, apparently
without being plugged into a wall outlet or any other source of power,
then you would look for a hidden battery, or a nearby broadcast power
source - something to explain the work being done, without violating
the laws of physics.</p>

<p>So if a mind is arriving at true beliefs, and we assume that the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o5/the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_and_engines_of/">second law of thermodynamics</a> has not been violated, that mind must be doing something at least <em>vaguely</em> Bayesian - at least one process with a sort-of Bayesian structure <em>somewhere</em> - or it <em>couldn't possibly work</em>.</p>

<a id="more"></a><p>In the beginning, at time T=0, a mind has no mutual information with
a subsystem S in its environment.&nbsp; At time T=1,the mind has 10 bits of
mutual information with S.&nbsp; Somewhere in between, the mind must have
encountered evidence - under the Bayesian definition of evidence,
because all Bayesian evidence is mutual information and all mutual
information is Bayesian evidence, they are just different ways of
looking at it - and processed at least some of that evidence, however
inefficiently, in the right direction according to Bayes on at least
some occasions.&nbsp; The mind must have <em>moved in harmony with the Bayes</em>
at least a little, somewhere along the line - either that or violated
the second law of thermodynamics by creating mutual information from
nothingness.</p>

<p>In fact, any <em>part</em> of a cognitive process that <em>contributes usefully</em>
to truth-finding must have at least a little Bayesian structure - must
harmonize with Bayes, at some point or another - must partially conform
with the Bayesian flow, however noisily - despite however many
disguising bells and whistles - even if this Bayesian structure is only
apparent in the context of surrounding processes.&nbsp; Or it couldn't even <em>help.</em></p>

<p>How philosophers pondered the nature of words!&nbsp; All the ink spent on the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/nq/feel_the_meaning/">true definitions of words</a>, and the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/">true meaning of definitions</a>, and the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/nn/neural_categories/">true meaning of meaning</a>!&nbsp; What collections of gears and wheels they built, in their explanations!&nbsp; And all along, it was a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/nm/disguised_queries/">disguised</a> form of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o2/mutual_information_and_density_in_thingspace/">Bayesian</a> <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ng/words_as_hidden_inferences/">inference</a>!</p>

<p>I was actually a bit disappointed that no one in the audience jumped up and said:&nbsp; &quot;<em>Yes!&nbsp; Yes, that's it!&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; It was really Bayes all along!</em>&quot;</p>

<p>But perhaps it is not <em>quite</em> as exciting to see something that <em>doesn't</em>
look Bayesian on the surface, revealed as Bayes wearing a clever
disguise, if: (a) you don't unravel the mystery yourself, but read
about someone else doing it (Newton had more fun than most students
taking calculus), and (b) you don't realize that <em>searching for the hidden Bayes-structure</em> is this huge, difficult, omnipresent quest, like searching for the Holy Grail.</p>

<p>It's a different quest for each facet of cognition, but the Grail always <em>turns out</em> to be the same.&nbsp; It has to be the <em>right</em> Grail, though - and the <em>entire</em> Grail, without any parts missing - and so each time you have to go on the quest looking for a full answer <em>whatever</em> form it may take, rather than trying to artificially construct vaguely hand-waving Grailish arguments.&nbsp; <em>Then</em> you always find the same Holy Grail at the end.</p>

<p>It was previously pointed out to me that I might be losing some of
my readers with the long essays, because I hadn't &quot;made it clear where
I was going&quot;...</p>

<p>...but it's <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/">not so easy</a> to just tell people where you're going, when you're going somewhere like <em>that.</em></p>

<p>It's not very helpful to merely <em>know that</em> a form of cognition is Bayesian, if you don't <em>know how</em> it is Bayesian.&nbsp; If you can't see the detailed flow of probability, you have nothing but a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/">password</a>
- or, a bit more charitably, a hint at the form an answer would take;
but certainly not an answer.&nbsp; That's why there's a Grand Quest for the
Hidden Bayes-Structure, rather than being done when you say &quot;Bayes!&quot; 
Bayes-structure can be buried under all kinds of disguies,
hidden behind thickets of wheels and gears, obscured by bells and
whistles.</p>

<p>The way you begin to grasp the Quest for the Holy Bayes is that you
learn about cognitive phenomenon XYZ, which seems really useful - and
there's this bunch of philosophers who've been arguing about its true
nature for centuries, and they are still arguing - and there's a bunch
of AI scientists trying to make a computer do it, but they can't agree
on the philosophy either -</p>

<p>And - <em>Huh, that's odd!</em> - this cognitive phenomenon didn't
look anything like Bayesian on the surface, but there's this
non-obvious underlying structure that has a Bayesian interpretation -
but wait, there's still some useful work getting done that can't be
explained in Bayesian terms - no wait, <em>that's</em> Bayesian too - OH MY GOD this <em>completely different</em> cognitive process, that <em>also</em> didn't look Bayesian on the surface, ALSO HAS BAYESIAN STRUCTURE - hold on, are these non-Bayesian parts even <em>doing</em> anything?</p>

<ul><li>Yes:&nbsp; Wow, those are Bayesian too!</li>

<li>No:&nbsp; Dear heavens, what a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/kt/evolutions_are_stupid_but_work_anyway/">stupid design</a>.&nbsp; I could eat a bucket of amino acids and puke a better brain architecture than that.</li></ul>

<p>Once this happens to you a few times, you kinda pick up the rhythm.&nbsp; That's what I'm talking about here, the rhythm.</p>

<p>Trying to talk about the rhythm is like trying to dance about architecture.</p>

<p>This left me in a bit of a pickle when it came to trying to explain
in advance where I was going.&nbsp; I know from experience that if I say,
&quot;Bayes is the secret of the universe,&quot; some people may say &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T1LIrzsgqA">Yes!</a>&nbsp; Bayes is the secret of the universe!&quot;; and others will snort and say, &quot;<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/mt/beautiful_probability/">How narrow-minded you are</a>; look at all these other ad-hoc but amazingly useful methods, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization#Bayesian_interpretation">regularized linear regression</a>, that <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/mt/beautiful_probability/">I have in my toolbox</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>I hoped that with a specific example in hand of &quot;something that doesn't look all that Bayesian on the surface, but <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/o2/mutual_information_and_density_in_thingspace/">turns out to be Bayesian after all</a>&quot; - <em>and</em> an explanation of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/">the difference between passwords and knowledge</a> - <em>and</em> an explanation of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/mt/beautiful_probability/">the difference between tools and laws</a> - maybe <em>then</em> I could convey such of the rhythm as can be understood without personally going on the quest.</p>

<p>Of course this is not the <em>full</em> Secret of the Bayesian
Conspiracy, but it's all that I can convey at this point.&nbsp; Besides, the
complete secret is known only to the Bayes Council, and if I told you,
I'd have to hire you.</p>

<p>To <em>see through</em> the surface adhockery of a cognitive process, to the Bayesian structure <em>underneath</em> - to perceive the probability flows, and <em>know how,</em> not just <em>know that,</em>
this cognition too is Bayesian - as it always is - as it always must be
- to be able to sense the Force underlying all cognition - this, is the
Bayes-Sight.</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;...And the Queen of Kashfa sees with the Eye of the Serpent.&quot;<br />
