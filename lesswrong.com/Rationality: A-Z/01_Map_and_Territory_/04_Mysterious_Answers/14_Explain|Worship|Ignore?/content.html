  <p>&#x201C;Why does water sometimes fall from the sky?&#x201D; I ask the bearded wise man of our tribe.</p>

  <p>He thinks for a moment, this question having never occurred to him before, and then says, &#x201C;From time to time, the sky spirits battle, and when they do, their blood drips from the sky.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>&#x201C;Where do the sky spirits come from?&#x201D; I ask.</p>

  <p>His voice drops to a whisper. &#x201C;From the before time. From the long long ago.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>When it rains, and you don&#x2019;t know why, you have several options. First, you could simply not ask why&#x2014;not follow up on the question, or never think of the question in the first place. This is the <span>I</span>gnore command, which the bearded wise man originally selected. Second, you could try to devise some sort of explanation, the <span>E</span>xplain command, as the bearded man did in response to your first question. Third, you could enjoy the sensation of mysteriousness&#x2014;the <span>W</span>orship command.</p>

  <p>Now, as you are bound to notice from this story, each time you select <span>E</span>xplain, the best-case scenario is that you get an explanation, such as &#x201C;sky spirits.&#x201D; But then this explanation itself is subject to the same dilemma&#x2014;<span>E</span>xplain, <span>W</span>orship, or <span>I</span>gnore? Each time you hit <span>E</span>xplain, science grinds for a while, returns an explanation, and then another dialog box pops up. As good rationalists, we feel duty-bound to keep hitting <span>E</span>xplain, but it seems like a road that has no end.</p>

  <p>You hit <span>E</span>xplain for life, and get chemistry; you hit <span>E</span>xplain for chemistry, and get atoms; you hit <span>E</span>xplain for atoms, and get electrons and nuclei; you hit <span>E</span>xplain for nuclei, and get quantum chromodynamics and quarks; you hit <span>E</span>xplain for how the quarks got there, and get back the Big Bang . . .</p>

  <p>We can hit <span>E</span>xplain for the Big Bang, and wait while science grinds through its process, and maybe someday it will return a perfectly good explanation. But then that will just bring up another dialog box. So, if we continue long enough, we must come to a <em>special</em> dialog box, a <em>new</em> option, an Explanation That Needs No Explanation, a place where the chain ends&#x2014;and this, maybe, is the only explanation worth knowing. </p>

  <p>There&#x2014;I just hit <span>W</span>orship.</p>

  <p>Never forget that there are many more ways to worship something than lighting candles around an altar.</p>

  <p>If I&#x2019;d said, &#x201C;Huh, that does seem paradoxical. I wonder how the apparent paradox is resolved?&#x201D; then I would have hit <span>E</span>xplain, which does sometimes take a while to produce an answer.</p>

  <p>And if the whole issue seems to you unimportant, or irrelevant, or if you&#x2019;d rather put off thinking about it until tomorrow, than you have hit <span>I</span>gnore.</p>

  <p>Select your option wisely.</p>
