<p>My parents always used to downplay the value of intelligence.&nbsp; And play up the value of&mdash;effort, as recommended by the latest research?&nbsp; No, not effort.&nbsp; <em>Experience.</em>&nbsp; A nicely unattainable hammer with which to smack down a bright young child, to be sure.&nbsp; That was what my parents told me when I questioned the Jewish religion, for example.&nbsp; I tried laying out an argument, and I was told something along the lines of:&nbsp; "Logic has limits, you'll understand when you're older that experience is the important thing, and then you'll see the truth of Judaism."&nbsp; I didn't try again.&nbsp; I made one attempt to question Judaism in school, got slapped down, didn't try again.&nbsp; I've never been a slow learner.</p>
<p>Whenever my parents were doing something ill-advised, it was always, "We know better because we have more experience.&nbsp; You'll understand when you're older: maturity and wisdom is more important than intelligence."</p>
<p>If this was an attempt to focus the young Eliezer on <em>intelligence uber alles,</em> it was the most wildly successful example of reverse psychology I've ever heard of.</p>
<p>But my parents aren't that cunning, and the results weren't exactly positive.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>For a long time, I thought that the moral of this story was that experience was no match for sheer raw native intelligence.&nbsp; It wasn't until a lot later, in my twenties, that I looked back and realized that I couldn't possibly have been more intelligent than my parents <em>before puberty,</em> with my brain not even fully developed.&nbsp; At age eleven, when I was already nearly a full-blown atheist, I could not have defeated my parents in any <em>fair</em> contest of mind.&nbsp; My SAT scores were high for an 11-year-old, but they wouldn't have beaten my parents' SAT scores in full adulthood.&nbsp; In a fair fight, my parents' intelligence and experience could have stomped any prepubescent child flat.&nbsp; It was dysrationalia that did them in; they used their intelligence only to defeat itself.</p>
<p>But <em>that</em> understanding came much later, when my intelligence had processed and distilled many more years of experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The moral I derived when I was young, was that anyone who downplayed the value of intelligence didn't understand intelligence at all.&nbsp; My own intelligence had affected every aspect of my life and mind and personality; that was massively obvious, seen at a backward glance.&nbsp; "Intelligence has nothing to do with wisdom or being a good person"&mdash;oh, and does self-awareness have nothing to do with wisdom, or being a good person?&nbsp; Modeling yourself takes intelligence.&nbsp; For one thing, it takes enough intelligence to learn evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>We <em>are</em> the cards we are dealt, and intelligence is the unfairest of all those cards.&nbsp; More unfair than wealth or health or home country, unfairer than your happiness set-point.&nbsp; People have difficulty accepting that life can be that unfair, it's not a happy thought.&nbsp; "Intelligence isn't as important as X" is one way of turning away from the unfairness, refusing to deal with it, thinking a happier thought instead.&nbsp; It's a temptation, both to those dealt poor cards, and to those dealt good ones.&nbsp; Just as downplaying the importance of money is a temptation both to the poor and to the rich.</p>
<p>But the young Eliezer was a transhumanist.&nbsp; Giving away IQ points was going to take more work than if I'd just been born with extra money.&nbsp; But it was a fixable problem, to be faced up to squarely, and fixed.&nbsp; Even if it took my whole life.&nbsp; "The strong exist to serve the weak," wrote the young Eliezer, "and can only discharge that duty by making others equally strong."&nbsp; I was annoyed with the Randian and Nietszchean trends in SF, and as you may have grasped, the young Eliezer had a tendency to take things <em>too far in the other direction</em>.&nbsp; No one exists only to serve.&nbsp; But I tried, and I don't regret that.&nbsp; If you call that teenage folly, it's rare to see adult wisdom doing better.</p>
<p>Everyone needed more intelligence.&nbsp; Including me, I was careful to pronounce.&nbsp; Be it far from me to declare a new world order with myself on top&mdash;that was what a stereotyped science fiction villain would do, or worse, a typical teenager, and I would never have allowed myself to be so cliched.&nbsp; No, <em>everyone</em> needed to be smarter.&nbsp; We were all in the same boat:&nbsp; A fine, uplifting thought.</p>
<p>Eliezer<sub>1995</sub> had read his science fiction.&nbsp; He had morals, and ethics, and could see the more obvious traps.&nbsp; No screeds on <em>Homo novis</em> for him.&nbsp; No line drawn between himself and others.&nbsp; No elaborate philosophy to put himself at the top of the heap.&nbsp; It was too obvious a failure mode.&nbsp; Yes, he was very careful to call himself stupid too, and never claim moral superiority.&nbsp; Well, and I don't see it so differently now, though I no longer make such a dramatic production out of my ethics.&nbsp; (Or maybe it would be more accurate to say that I'm tougher about when I allow myself a moment of self-congratulation.)</p>
<p>I say all this to emphasize that Eliezer<sub>1995</sub> wasn't so undignified as to fail in any <em>obvious</em> way.</p>
<p>And then Eliezer<sub>1996</sub> encountered the concept of the Singularity.&nbsp; Was it a thunderbolt of revelation?&nbsp; Did I jump out of my chair and shout "Eurisko!"?&nbsp; Nah.&nbsp; I wasn't that much of a drama queen.&nbsp; It was just massively obvious in retrospect that smarter-than-human intelligence was going to change the future more fundamentally than any mere material science.&nbsp; And I knew at once that <em>this</em> was what I would be doing with the rest of my life, creating the Singularity.&nbsp; Not nanotechnology like I'd thought when I was eleven years old; nanotech would only be a tool brought forth of intelligence.&nbsp; Why, intelligence was even <em>more</em> powerful, an even greater blessing, than I'd realized before.</p>
<p>Was this a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/lm/affective_death_spirals/">happy death spiral</a>?&nbsp; As it turned out later, yes: that is, it led to the adoption even of <em>false</em> happy beliefs about intelligence.&nbsp; Perhaps you could draw the line at the point where I started believing that surely the lightspeed limit would be no barrier to superintelligence.&nbsp; (It's not <em>unthinkable,</em> but I wouldn't bet on it.)</p>
<p>But the real wrong turn came later, at the point where someone said, "Hey, how do you know that superintelligence will be moral?&nbsp; Intelligence has nothing to do with being a good person, you know&mdash;that's what we call wisdom, young prodigy."</p>
<p>And lo, it seemed obvious to the young Eliezer, that this was mere denial.&nbsp; Certainly, his own painstakingly constructed code of ethics had been put together using his intelligence and resting on his intelligence as a base.&nbsp; Any fool could see that intelligence had a great deal to do with ethics, morality, and wisdom; just try explaining the Prisoner's Dilemma to a chimpanzee, right?</p>
<p>Surely, then, superintelligence would necessarily imply supermorality.</p>
<p>Thus is it said:&nbsp; "Parents do all the things they tell their children not to do, which is how they know not to do them."&nbsp; To be continued, hopefully tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Post Scriptum</strong>:&nbsp; How my views on intelligence have changed since then... let's see:&nbsp; When I think of poor hands dealt to humans, these days, I think first of death and old age.&nbsp; Everyone's got to have some intelligence level or other, and the important thing from a fun-theoretical perspective is that it should ought to <em>increase</em> over time, not decrease like now.&nbsp; Isn't that a clever way of feeling better?&nbsp; But I don't work so hard now at downplaying my own intelligence, because that's just another way of calling attention to it.&nbsp; I'm smart for a human, if the topic should arise, and how I feel about that is my own business.&nbsp; The part about intelligence being the lever that lifts worlds is the same.&nbsp; Except that intelligence has become less mysterious unto me, so that I now more clearly see intelligence as something embedded within physics.&nbsp; Superintelligences may go FTL if it happens to be permitted by the true physical laws, and if not, then not.</p>
