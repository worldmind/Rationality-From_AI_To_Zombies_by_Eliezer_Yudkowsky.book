<p>(At this point, I fear that I must recurse into a subsequence; but if all goes as planned, it really <em>will</em> be short.)</p>
<p>I once lent Xiaoguang "Mike" Li my copy of "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science".&nbsp; Mike Li read some of it, and then came back and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wow... it's like Jaynes is a thousand-year-old vampire."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mike said, "No, wait, let me explain that&mdash;" and I said, "No, I know exactly what you mean."&nbsp; It's a convention in fantasy literature that the older a vampire gets, the more powerful they become.</p>
<p>I'd enjoyed math proofs before I encountered Jaynes.&nbsp; But E.T. Jaynes was the first time I picked up a sense of <em>formidability</em> from mathematical arguments.&nbsp; Maybe because Jaynes was lining up "paradoxes" that had been used to object to Bayesianism, and then blasting them to pieces with overwhelming firepower&mdash;power being used to overcome others.&nbsp; Or maybe the sense of formidability came from Jaynes not treating his math as a game of aesthetics; Jaynes <em>cared</em> about probability theory, it was bound up with other considerations that mattered, to him and to me too.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the sense I get of Jaynes is one of terrifying swift perfection&mdash;something that would arrive at the correct answer by the shortest possible route, tearing all surrounding mistakes to shreds in the same motion.&nbsp; Of course, when you write a book, you get a chance to show only your best side.&nbsp; But still.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>It spoke well of Mike Li that he was able to sense the aura of formidability surrounding Jaynes.&nbsp; It's a general rule, I've observed, that you can't discriminate between levels too far above your own. E.g., someone once earnestly told me that I was really bright, and "ought to go to college".&nbsp; Maybe anything more than around one standard deviation above you starts to blur together, though that's just a cool-sounding wild guess.</p>
<p>So, having heard Mike Li compare Jaynes to a thousand-year-old vampire, one question immediately popped into my mind:</p>
<p>"Do you get the same sense off me?" I asked.</p>
<p>Mike shook his head.&nbsp; "Sorry," he said, sounding somewhat awkward, "it's just that Jaynes is..."</p>
<p>"No, I know," I said.&nbsp; I hadn't thought I'd reached Jaynes's level. I'd only been curious about how I came across to other people.</p>
<p>I <em>aspire</em> to Jaynes's level.&nbsp; I <em>aspire</em> to become as much the master of Artificial Intelligence / reflectivity, as Jaynes was master of Bayesian probability theory.&nbsp; I can even plead that the art I'm trying to master is more difficult than Jaynes's, making a mockery of deference.&nbsp; Even so, and embarrassingly, there is <em>no</em> art of which I am as much the master now, as Jaynes was of probability theory.</p>
<p>This is not, necessarily, to place myself beneath Jaynes as a person&mdash;to say that Jaynes had a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/qs/einsteins_superpowers/">magical aura of destiny</a>, and I don't.</p>
<p>Rather I recognize in Jaynes <em>a level of expertise, of sheer formidability,</em> which I have not yet achieved.&nbsp; I can argue forcefully in my chosen subject, but that is not the same as writing out the equations and saying:<strong>&nbsp; DONE.</strong></p>
<p>For so long as I have not yet achieved that level, I must acknowledge the possibility that I can never achieve it, that my native talent is not sufficient.&nbsp; When Marcello Herreshoff had known me for long enough, I asked him if he knew of anyone who struck him as substantially more <em>natively intelligent</em> than myself.&nbsp; Marcello thought for a moment and said "John Conway&mdash;I met him at a summer math camp."&nbsp; <em>Darn,</em> I thought, <em>he thought of someone, and worse, it's some ultra-famous old guy I can't grab.</em>&nbsp; I inquired how Marcello had arrived at the judgment.&nbsp; Marcello said, "He just struck me as having a tremendous amount of mental horsepower," and started to explain a math problem he'd had a chance to work on with Conway.</p>
<p>Not what I wanted to hear.</p>
<p>Perhaps, relative to Marcello's experience of Conway and his experience of me, I haven't had a chance to show off on any subject that I've mastered as thoroughly as Conway had mastered his many fields of mathematics.</p>
<p>Or it might be that Conway's brain is specialized off in a different direction from mine, and that I could never approach Conway's level on math, yet Conway wouldn't do so well on AI research.</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>...or I'm strictly dumber than Conway, dominated by him along all dimensions.&nbsp; Maybe, if I could find a young proto-Conway and tell them the basics, they would blaze right past me, solve the problems that have weighed on me for years, and zip off to places I can't follow.</p>
<p>Is it damaging to my ego to confess that last possibility?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; It would be futile to deny that.</p>
<p>Have I <em>really</em> accepted that awful possibility, or am I only pretending to myself to have accepted it?&nbsp; Here I will say:&nbsp; "No, I think I have accepted it."&nbsp; Why do I dare give myself so much credit?&nbsp; Because I've invested specific effort into that awful possibility.&nbsp; I am blogging here for many reasons, but a major one is the vision of some younger mind reading these words and zipping off past me.&nbsp; It might happen, it might not.</p>
<p>Or sadder:&nbsp; Maybe I just wasted too much time on setting up the resources to support me, instead of studying math full-time through my whole youth; or I wasted too much youth on non-mathy ideas.&nbsp; And this choice, my past, is irrevocable.&nbsp; I'll hit a brick wall at 40, and there won't be anything left but to pass on the resources to another mind with the potential I wasted, still young enough to learn.&nbsp; So to save them time, I should leave a trail to my successes, and post warning signs on my mistakes.</p>
<p>Such <em>specific efforts</em> predicated on an ego-damaging possibility&mdash;that's the only kind of humility that seems real enough for me to dare credit myself.&nbsp; Or giving up my precious theories, when I realized that they didn't meet the standard Jaynes had shown me&mdash;that was hard, and it was real.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/gq/the_proper_use_of_humility/">Modest demeanors are cheap</a>.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/ib/the_proper_use_of_doubt/">Humble admissions of doubt are cheap</a>.&nbsp; I've known too many people who, presented with a counterargument, say "I am but a fallible mortal, of course I could be wrong" and then go on to do exactly what they planned to do previously.</p>
<p>You'll note that I don't try to modestly say anything like, "Well, I may not be as brilliant as Jaynes or Conway, but that doesn't mean I can't do important things in my chosen field."</p>
<p>Because I do know... that's not how it works.</p>
