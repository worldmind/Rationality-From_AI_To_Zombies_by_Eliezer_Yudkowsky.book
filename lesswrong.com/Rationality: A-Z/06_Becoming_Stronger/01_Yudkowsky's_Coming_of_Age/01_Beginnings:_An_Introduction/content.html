                        <p>This, the final book of <em>Rationality: From AI to Zombies</em>, is less a conclusion than a
                            call to action. In keeping with <em>Becoming Stronger</em>’s function as a jumping-off point
                            for further investigation, I’ll conclude by citing resources the reader can use to move
                            beyond these sequences and seek out a fuller understanding of Bayesianism.
                        </p>
                        <p>This text’s definition of normative rationality in terms of Bayesian probability theory and
                            decision theory is standard in cognitive science. For an introduction to the heuristics and
                            biases approach, see Baron’s <em>Thinking and Deciding</em>.[1] For a general introduction
                            to the field, see the <em>Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning</em>.[2]
                        </p>
                        <p>The arguments made in these pages about the <em>philosophy </em>of rationality are more
                            controversial. Yudkowsky argues, for example, that a rational agent should one-box in
                            Newcomb’s Problem—a minority position among working decision theorists.[3] (See <a
                                href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/egghead/2002/02/thinkinginside_the_boxes.single.html">Holt</a>
                            for a nontechnical description of Newcomb’s Problem.[4]) Gary Drescher’s <em>Good and
                                Real</em> independently comes to many of the same conclusions as Yudkowsky on philosophy
                            of science and decision theory.[5] As such, it serves as an excellent book-length treatment
                            of the core philosophical content of <em>Rationality: From AI to Zombies</em>.</p>
                        <p><a

                            distinguishes several views in Bayesian epistemology, including E. T. Jaynes’s position that
                            not all possible priors are equally reasonable.[6,7] Like Jaynes, Yudkowsky is interested in
                            supplementing the Bayesian optimality criterion for belief revision with an optimality
                            criterion for priors. This aligns Yudkowsky with researchers who hope to better understand
                            general-purpose AI via an improved theory of ideal reasoning, such as Marcus Hutter.[8] For
                            a broader discussion of philosophical efforts to naturalize theories of knowledge, see <a
                                href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/epistemology-naturalized/">Feldman</a>.[9]

                            “Bayesianism” is often contrasted with “frequentism.” Some frequentists criticize Bayesians
                            for treating probabilities as subjective states of belief, rather than as objective
                            frequencies of events. <a
                                href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/Kruschke2010TiCS.pdf">Kruschke</a> and
                            <a
                                href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1gc/frequentist_statistics_are_frequently_subjective/">Yudkowsky</a>
                            have replied that frequentism is even more “subjective” than Bayesianism, because
                            frequentism’s probability assignments depend on the intentions of the experimenter.[10]</p>
                        <p>
                            Importantly, this philosophical disagreement shouldn’t be conflated with the distinction
                            between Bayesian and frequentist data analysis methods, which can both be useful when
                            employed correctly. Bayesian statistical tools have become cheaper to use since the 1980s,
                            and their informativeness, intuitiveness, and generality have come to be more widely
                            appreciated, resulting in “Bayesian revolutions” in many sciences. However, traditional
                            frequentist methods re- main more popular, and in some contexts they are still clearly
                            superior to Bayesian approaches. Kruschke’s <em>Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</em> is a fun
                            and accessible introduction to the topic.[11]</p>
                        <p>
                            In light of evidence that training in statistics—and some other fields, such as
                            psychology—improves reasoning skills outside the classroom, statistical literacy is directly
                            relevant to the project of overcoming bias. (Classes in formal logic and informal fallacies
                            have not proven similarly useful.)[12,13]</p>
                        <p>&nbsp</p>
                        <h3>An Art in its Infancy</h3>
                        <p>We conclude with three sequences on individual and collective self- improvement. “Yudkowsky’s
                            Coming of Age” provides a last in-depth illustration of the dynamics of irrational belief,
                            this time spotlighting the author’s own intellectual history. “Challenging the Difficult”
                            asks what it takes to solve a truly difficult problem—including demands that go beyond
                            epistemic rationality. Finally, “The Craft and the Community” discusses rationality groups
                            and group rationality, raising the questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p> Can rationality be learned and taught? </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>If so, how much improvement is possible? </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>How can we be confident we’re seeing a real effect in a rationality intervention, and
                                    picking out the right cause?
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>What community norms would make this process of bettering ourselves easier?</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Can we effectively collaborate on large-scale problems without sacrificing our
                                    freedom of thought and conduct?
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Above all: What’s missing? What should be in the next generation of rationality primers—the
                            ones that replace this text, improve on its style, test its prescriptions, supplement its
                            content, and branch out in altogether new directions?
                        </p>
                        <p>Though Yudkowsky was moved to write these essays by his own philosophical mistakes and
                            professional difficulties in AI theory, the resultant material has proven useful to a much
                            wider audience. The original blog posts inspired the growth of <em>Less Wrong</em>, a
                            community of intellectuals and life hackers with shared interests in cognitive science,
                            computer science, and philosophy. Yudkowsky and other writers on <em>Less Wrong </em>have
                            helped seed the effective altruism movement, a vibrant and audacious effort to identify the
                            most high-impact humanitarian charities and causes. These writings also sparked the
                            establishment of the Center for Applied Rationality, a nonprofit organization that attempts
                            to translate results from the science of rationality into useable techniques for
                            self-improvement.</p>
                        <p>
                            I don’t know what’s next—what other unconventional projects or ideas might draw inspiration
                            from these pages. We certainly face no shortage of global challenges, and the art of applied
                            rationality is a new and half-formed thing. There are not many rationalists, and there are
                            many things left undone.
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            But wherever you’re headed next, reader—may you serve your purpose well.
