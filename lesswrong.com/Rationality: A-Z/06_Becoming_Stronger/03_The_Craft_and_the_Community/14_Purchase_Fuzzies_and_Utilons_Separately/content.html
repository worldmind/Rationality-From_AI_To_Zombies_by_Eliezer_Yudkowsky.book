<p>Yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There <em>is</em> this very, very old puzzle/observation in economics about the lawyer who spends an hour volunteering at the soup kitchen, instead of working an extra hour and donating the money to hire someone...</p>
<p>If the lawyer needs to work an hour at the soup kitchen to keep himself motivated and remind himself why he's doing what he's doing, <em>that's fine.</em>&nbsp; But he should <em>also</em> be donating some of the hours he worked at the office, because that is the power of professional specialization and it is how grownups really get things done.&nbsp; One might consider the check as buying the right to volunteer at the soup kitchen, or validating the time spent at the soup kitchen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hold open doors for little old ladies.&nbsp; I can't actually remember the last time this happened literally (though I'm sure it has, sometime in the last year or so).&nbsp; But within the last month, say, I was out on a walk and discovered a station wagon parked in a driveway with its trunk completely open, giving full access to the car's interior.&nbsp; I looked in to see if there were packages being taken out, but this was not so.&nbsp; I looked around to see if anyone was doing anything with the car.&nbsp; And finally I went up to the house and knocked, then rang the bell.&nbsp; And yes, the trunk had been accidentally left open.</p>
<p>Under other circumstances, this would be a simple act of altruism, which might signify true concern for another's welfare, or fear of guilt for inaction, or a desire to signal trustworthiness to oneself or others, or finding altruism pleasurable.&nbsp; I think that these are all perfectly legitimate motives, by the way; I might give bonus points for the first, but I wouldn't deduct any penalty points for the others.&nbsp; Just so long as people get helped.</p>
<p>But in my own case, since I already work in the nonprofit sector, the further question arises as to whether I could have better employed the same sixty seconds in a more <em>specialized</em> way, to bring greater benefit to others.&nbsp; That is: can I really defend this as the <em>best</em> use of my time, given the other things I claim to believe?<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>The obvious defense&mdash;or perhaps, obvious rationalization&mdash;is that an act of altruism like this one acts as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">willpower restorer</a>, much more efficiently than, say, listening to music.&nbsp; I also mistrust my ability to be an altruist <em>only</em> in theory; I suspect that if I walk past problems, my altruism will start to fade.&nbsp; I've never pushed that far enough to test it; it doesn't seem worth the risk.</p>
<p>But if that's the defense, then my act can't be defended as a good deed, can it?&nbsp; For these are self-directed benefits that I list.</p>
<p>Well&mdash;who said that I <em>was</em> defending the act as a selfless good deed?&nbsp; It's a <em>selfish</em> good deed.&nbsp; If it restores my willpower, or if it keeps me altruistic, then there are indirect other-directed benefits from that (or so I believe).&nbsp; You could, of course, reply that you don't trust selfish acts that are supposed to be other-benefiting as an "ulterior motive"; but then I could just as easily respond that, by the same principle, you should just look directly at the original good deed rather than <em>its</em> supposed ulterior motive.</p>
<p>Can I get away with that?&nbsp; That is, can I really get away with calling it a "selfish good deed", and still derive willpower restoration therefrom, rather than feeling guilt about it being selfish?&nbsp; Apparently I can.&nbsp; I'm surprised it works out that way, but it does.&nbsp; So long as I knock to tell them about the open trunk, and so long as the one says "Thank you!", my brain feels like it's done its wonderful good deed for the day.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary, of course.&nbsp; The problem with trying to work out an art of willpower restoration is that different things seem to work for different people.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/11/chaotic-inversi.html">That is</a>:&nbsp; We're probing around on the level of surface phenomena without understanding the deeper rules that would also predict the variations.)</p>
<p>But if you find that you are like me in this aspect&mdash;that selfish good deeds still work&mdash;then I recommend that you <em>purchase warm fuzzies and utilons separately.</em>&nbsp; Not at the same time.&nbsp; Trying to do both at the same time just means that neither ends up done well.&nbsp; If status matters to you, purchase status separately too!</p>
<p>If I had to give advice to some new-minted billionaire entering the realm of charity, my advice would go something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>To purchase warm fuzzies, find some hard-working but poverty-stricken woman who's about to drop out of state college after her husband's hours were cut back, and personally, but anonymously, give her a cashier's check for $10,000.&nbsp; Repeat as desired.</li>
<li>To purchase status among your friends, donate $100,000 to the current sexiest X-Prize, or whatever other charity seems to offer the most stylishness for the least price.&nbsp; Make a big deal out of it, show up for their press events, and brag about it for the next five years.</li>
<li>Then&mdash;with absolute cold-blooded calculation&mdash;without <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/scope_insensiti.html">scope insensitivity</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_aversion">ambiguity aversion</a>&mdash;without concern for status or warm fuzzies&mdash;figuring out some common scheme for converting outcomes to utilons, and trying to express uncertainty in percentage probabilitiess&mdash;find the charity that offers the greatest expected utilons per dollar.&nbsp; Donate up to however much money you wanted to give to charity, until their marginal efficiency drops below that of the next charity on the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would furthermore advise the billionaire that what they spend on utilons should be at least, say, 20 times what they spend on warm fuzzies&mdash;5% overhead on keeping yourself altruistic seems reasonable, and I, your dispassionate judge, would have no trouble <em>validating </em>the warm fuzzies against a multiplier that large.&nbsp; Save that the original, fuzzy act really should be helpful rather than actively harmful.</p>
<p>(Purchasing <em>status</em> seems to me essentially unrelated to altruism.&nbsp; If giving money to the X-Prize gets you more awe from your friends than an equivalently priced speedboat, then there's really no reason to buy the speedboat.&nbsp; Just put the money under the "impressing friends" column, and be aware that this is not the "altruism" column.)</p>
<p>But the main lesson is that all three of these things&mdash;warm fuzzies, status, and expected utilons&mdash;can be bought <em>far</em> more efficiently when you buy <em>separately</em>, optimizing for only one thing at a time.&nbsp; Writing a check for $10,000,000 to a breast-cancer charity&mdash;while far more laudable than spending the same $10,000,000 on, I don't know, parties or something&mdash;won't give you the concentrated euphoria of being present in person when you turn a single human's life around, probably not anywhere <em>close</em>.&nbsp; It won't give you as much to talk about at parties as donating to something sexy like an X-Prize&mdash;maybe a short nod from the other rich.&nbsp; And if you threw away all concern for warm fuzzies and status, there are probably at least a <em>thousand</em> underserved existing charities that could produce <em>orders of magnitude</em> more utilons with ten million dollars.&nbsp; Trying to optimize for all three criteria in one go only ensures that none of them end up optimized very well&mdash;just vague pushes along all three dimensions.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're not a millionaire or even a billionaire&mdash;then you can't be quite as <em>efficient</em> about things, can't so easily purchase in bulk.&nbsp; But I would still say&mdash;for warm fuzzies, find a relatively <em>cheap </em>charity with bright, vivid, ideally in-person and direct beneficiaries.&nbsp; Volunteer at a soup kitchen.&nbsp; Or just get your warm fuzzies from holding open doors for little old ladies.&nbsp; Let that be <em>validated</em> by your other efforts to purchase utilons, but don't <em>confuse</em> it with purchasing utilons.&nbsp; Status is probably cheaper to purchase by buying nice clothes.</p>
<p>And when it comes to purchasing expected utilons&mdash;then, of course, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/circular-altrui.html">shut up and multiply</a>.</p>
