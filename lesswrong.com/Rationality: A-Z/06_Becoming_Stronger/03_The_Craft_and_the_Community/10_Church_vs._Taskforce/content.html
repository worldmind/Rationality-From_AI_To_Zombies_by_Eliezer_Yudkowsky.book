<p>I am generally suspicious of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate">envying crazy groups</a> or trying to <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/is-humanism-rel.html">blindly copycat the rhythm of religion</a>&mdash;what I called "hymns to the nonexistence of God", replying, "A good 'atheistic hymn' is simply a song about anything worth singing about that doesn't happen to be religious."</p>
<p>But religion does fill certain holes in people's minds, some of which are even worth filling.&nbsp; If you eliminate religion, you have to be aware of what gaps are left behind.</p>
<p>If you suddenly deleted religion from the world, the largest gap left would not be anything of ideals or morals; it would be the church, the community.&nbsp; Among those who now stay religious without quite really believing in God&mdash;how many are just sticking to it from wanting to stay with their neighbors at the church, and their family and friends?&nbsp; How many would convert to atheism, if all those others deconverted, and <em>that</em> were the price of staying in the community and keeping its respect?&nbsp; I would guess... probably quite a lot.</p>
<p>In truth... this is probably something I don't understand all that well, myself.&nbsp; "Brownies and babysitting" were the first two things that came to mind.&nbsp; Do churches lend helping hands in emergencies?&nbsp; Or just a shoulder to cry on?&nbsp; How strong is a church community?&nbsp; It probably depends on the church, and in any case, that's not the correct question.&nbsp; One should start by considering what a hunter-gatherer band gives its people, and ask what's missing in modern life&mdash;if a modern First World church fills only <em>some</em> of that, then by all means let us try to do <em>better</em>.</p>
<p>So <em>without</em> copycatting religion&mdash;<em>without</em> assuming that we <em>must </em>gather every Sunday morning in a building with stained-glass windows while the children dress up in formal clothes and listen to someone sing&mdash;let's consider how to fill the emotional gap, after religion stops being an option.<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>To help break the mold to start with&mdash;the straitjacket of <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/cached-thoughts.html">cached thoughts</a> on how to do this sort of thing&mdash;consider that <em>some</em> modern offices may also fill the same role as a church.&nbsp; By which I mean that some people are fortunate to receive community from their workplaces: friendly coworkers who bake brownies for the office, whose teenagers can be safely hired for babysitting, and maybe even help in times of catastrophe...?&nbsp; But certainly not everyone is lucky enough to find a community at the office.</p>
<p>Consider further&mdash;a church is <em>ostensibly</em> about worship, and a workplace is <em>ostensibly</em> about the commercial purpose of the organization.&nbsp; Neither has been carefully <em>optimized</em> to serve as a community.</p>
<p>Looking at a typical religious church, for example, you could suspect&mdash;although all of these things would be better tested experimentally, than just suspected&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>That getting up early on a Sunday morning is not optimal;</li>
<li>That wearing formal clothes is not optimal, especially for children;</li>
<li>That listening to the same person give sermons on the same theme every week ("religion") is not optimal;</li>
<li>That the cost of supporting a church and a pastor is expensive, compared to the number of different communities who could time-share the same building for their gatherings;</li>
<li>That they probably don't serve <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/05/why_dont_people.html">nearly enough</a> of a matchmaking purpose, because churches think they're supposed to enforce their medieval moralities;</li>
<li>That the whole thing ought to be subject to experimental data-gathering to find out what works and what doesn't.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using the word "optimal" above, I mean "optimal under the criteria you would use if you were explicitly building a community <em>qua</em> community".&nbsp; Spending lots of money on a fancy church with stained-glass windows and a full-time pastor makes sense if you actually <em>want</em> to spend money on religion <em>qua</em> religion.</p>
<p>I do confess that when walking past the churches of my city, my main thought is "These buildings look really, really expensive, and there are too many of them."&nbsp; If you were doing it over from scratch... then you might have a big building that could be used for the occasional wedding, but it would be time-shared for different communities meeting at different times on the weekend, and it would also have a nice large video display that could be used for speakers giving presentations, lecturers teaching something, or maybe even showing movies.&nbsp; Stained glass?&nbsp; Not so high a priority.</p>
<p>Or to the extent that the church membership lends a helping hand in times of trouble&mdash;could that be improved by an explicit rainy-day fund or contracting with an insurer, once you realized that this was an important function?&nbsp; Possibly <em>not;</em> dragging explicit finance into things changes their character oddly.&nbsp; Conversely, maybe keeping current on some insurance policies should be a <em>requirement</em> for membership, lest you rely <em>too much</em> on the community...&nbsp; But again, to the extent that churches provide community, they're trying to do it without actually <em>admitting</em> that this nearly all of what people get out of it.&nbsp; Same thing with the corporations whose workplaces are friendly enough to serve as communities; it's still something of an accidental function.</p>
<p>Once you start thinking <em>explicitly </em>about how to give people a hunter-gatherer band to belong to, you can see all sorts of things that sound like good ideas.&nbsp; Should you welcome the newcomer in your midst?&nbsp; The pastor may give a sermon on that sometime, if you think church is about religion.&nbsp; But if you're explicitly setting out to build community&mdash;then right after a move is when someone most lacks community, when they most need your help.&nbsp; It's also an opportunity for the band to grow.&nbsp; If anything, tribes ought to be competing at quarterly exhibitions to capture newcomers.</p>
<p>But can you really have a community that's <em>just</em> a community&mdash;that isn't also an office or a religion?&nbsp; A community with no purpose beyond itself?</p>
<p>Maybe you <em>can.</em>&nbsp; After all, hunter-gatherer tribes have any purposes beyond themselves?&mdash;well, there was survival and feeding yourselves, that was a purpose.</p>
<p>But anything that people have in common, especially any <em>goal</em> they have in common, tends to <em>want</em> to define a community.&nbsp; Why not take advantage of that?</p>
<p>Though in this age of the Internet, alas, too many binding factors have supporters too widely distributed to form a decent band&mdash;if you're the only member of the Church of the Subgenius in your city, it may not really help much.&nbsp; It really is different without the physical presence; the Internet does <em>not</em> seem to be an acceptable substitute at the current stage of the technology.</p>
<p>So to skip right to the point&mdash;</p>
<p>Should the Earth last so long, I would like to see, as the form of rationalist communities, taskforces focused on <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/interlude-with-the-confessor.html">all the work that needs doing to fix up this world</a>.&nbsp; Communities in any geographic area would form around the most specific cluster that could support a decent-sized band.&nbsp; If your city doesn't have enough people in it for you to find 50 fellow Linux programmers, you might have to settle for 15 fellow open-source programmers... or in the days when all of this is only getting started, 15 fellow rationalists trying to spruce up the Earth in their assorted ways.</p>
<p>That's what I think would be a fitting direction for the energies of communities, and a common purpose that would bind them together.&nbsp; Tasks like that need communities anyway, and this Earth has plenty of work that needs doing, so there's no point in waste.&nbsp; We have so much that needs doing&mdash;let the energy that was once wasted into the void of religious institutions, find an outlet there.&nbsp; And let purposes <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/57/the_sacred_mundane/">admirable without need for delusion</a>, fill any void in the community structure left by deleting religion and its illusionary <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/higher-purpose.html">higher purposes</a>.</p>
<p>Strong communities built around worthwhile purposes:&nbsp; That would be the shape I would like to see for the post-religious age, or whatever fraction of humanity has then gotten so far in their lives.</p>
<p>Although... as long as you've got a building with a nice large high-resolution screen anyway, I wouldn't mind challenging the idea that all post-adulthood learning has to take place in distant expensive university campuses with teachers who would rather be doing something else.&nbsp; And it's empirically the case that colleges seem to support communities quite well.&nbsp; So in all fairness, there are other possibilities for things you could build a post-theistic community around.</p>
<p>Is all of this just a dream?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; Probably.&nbsp; It's not completely devoid of incremental implementability, if you've got enough rationalists in a sufficiently large city who have heard of the idea.&nbsp; But on the off-chance that rationality should catch on so widely, or the Earth should last so long, and that my voice should be heard, then that is the direction I would like to see things moving in&mdash;as the churches fade, we don't need artificial churches, but we do need new idioms of community.</p>
