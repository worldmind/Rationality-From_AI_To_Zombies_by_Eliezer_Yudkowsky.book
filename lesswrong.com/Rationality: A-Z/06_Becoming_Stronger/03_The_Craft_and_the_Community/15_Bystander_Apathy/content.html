<p>The bystander effect, also known as bystander apathy, is that larger groups are less likely to act in emergencies - not just individually, but collectively.&nbsp; Put an experimental subject alone in a room and let smoke start coming up from under the door.&nbsp; 75% of the subjects will leave to report it.&nbsp; Now put <em>three</em> subjects in the room - real subjects, none of whom know what's going on.&nbsp; On only 38% of the occasions will <em>anyone</em> report the smoke.&nbsp; Put the subject with two confederates who ignore the smoke, and they'll only report it 10% on the time - even staying in the room until it becomes hazy.&nbsp; (Latane and Darley 1969.)</p>
<p>On the standard model, the two primary drivers of bystander apathy are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Diffusion of responsibility</em> - everyone hopes that someone else will be first to step up and incur any costs of acting.&nbsp; When no one does act, being part of a crowd provides an excuse and reduces the chance of being held personally responsible for the results.</li>
<li><a href="/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate"><em>Pluralistic ignorance</em></a> - people try to <em>appear </em>calm while looking for cues, and see... that the others appear calm.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cialdini (2001):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very often an emergency is not obviously an emergency.&nbsp; Is the man lying in the alley a heart-attack victim or a drunk sleeping one off?&nbsp; ...&nbsp; In times of such uncertainty, the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues.&nbsp; We can learn from the way the other witnesses are reacting whether the event is or is not an emergency.&nbsp; What is easy to forget, though, is that everybody else observing the event is likely to be looking for social evidence, too.&nbsp; Because we all prefer to appear poised and unflustered among others, we are likely to search for that evidence placidly, with brief, camouflaged glances at those around us.&nbsp; Therefore everyone is likely to see everyone else looking unruffled and failing to act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cialdini suggests that if you're ever in emergency need of help, you point to <em>one single </em>bystander and ask them for help - making it very clear to whom you're referring.&nbsp; Remember that the <em>total</em> group, combined, may have less chance of helping than one individual.<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>I've mused a bit on the evolutionary psychology of the bystander effect.&nbsp; Suppose that in the ancestral environment, most people in your band were likely to be at least a little related to you - enough to be worth saving, if you were the only one who could do it.&nbsp; But if there are two others present, then the <em>first</em> person to act incurs a cost, while the other two both reap the <em>genetic</em> benefit of a partial relative being saved.&nbsp; Could there have been an arms race for who waited the longest?</p>
<p>As far as I've followed this line of speculation, it doesn't seem to be a good explanation - at the point where the whole group is failing to act, a gene that helps immediately ought to be able to invade, I would think.&nbsp; The experimental result is not a long wait before helping, but simply failure to help: if it's a genetic benefit to help when you're the only person who can do it (as <em>does</em> happen in the experiments) then the group equilibrium should not be <em>no</em> one helping (as happens in the experiments).</p>
<p>So I don't think an arms race of delay is a plausible evolutionary explanation.&nbsp; More likely, I think, is that we're looking at a nonancestral problem.&nbsp; If the experimental subjects actually <em>know</em> the apparent victim, the chances of helping go way up (i.e., we're not looking at the correlate of helping an actual fellow band member).&nbsp; If I recall correctly, if the experimental subjects know each <em>other</em>, the chances of action also go up.</p>
<p>Nervousness about public action may also play a role.&nbsp; If Robin Hanson is right about <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/04/choke-to-submit.html">the evolutionary role of "choking"</a>, then being <em>first</em> to act in an emergency might also be taken as a dangerous bid for high status.&nbsp; (Come to think, I can't actually recall seeing <em>shyness </em>discussed in analyses of the bystander effect, but that's probably <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/no-one-knows-wh.html">just my poor memory</a>.)</p>
<p>Can the bystander effect be explained primarily by diffusion of moral responsibility?&nbsp; We could be cynical and suggest that people are mostly interested in <em>not being blamed</em> for not helping, rather than having any positive desire to help - that they mainly wish to escape antiheroism and possible retribution.&nbsp; Something like this may well be a contributor, but two observations that mitigate against it are (a) the experimental subjects did not report smoke coming in from under the door, even though it could well have represented a strictly selfish threat and (b) telling people about the bystander effect reduces the bystander effect, even though they're no more likely to be held publicly responsible thereby.</p>
<p>In fact, the bystander effect is one of the main cases I recall offhand where telling people about a bias actually seems able to strongly reduce it - maybe because the appropriate way to compensate is so obvious, and it's not easy to <em>over</em>compensate (as when you're trying to e.g. adjust your calibration).&nbsp; So we should be careful not to be too cynical about the implications of the bystander effect and diffusion of responsibility, if we interpret individual action in terms of a cold, calculated attempt to avoid public censure.&nbsp; People seem at least to sometimes hold <em>themselves</em> responsible, once they realize they're the only ones who know enough about the bystander effect to be likely to act.</p>
<p>Though I wonder what happens if you know that you're part of a crowd where <em>everyone</em> has been told about the bystander effect...</p>
