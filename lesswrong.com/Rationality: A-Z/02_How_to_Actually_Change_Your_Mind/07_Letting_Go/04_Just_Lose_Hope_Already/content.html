He took cash out of the mortgage (applied for larger amounts than the price of the house) and spent the money on living expenses and real-estate seminars. He was expecting the market to go up, it seems. </p>

  <p>That&#x2019;s not even the sad part. The sad part is that <em>he still hasn&#x2019;t given up.</em> Casey Serin does not accept defeat. He refuses to declare bankruptcy, or get a job; he still thinks he can make it big in real estate. He went on spending money on seminars. He tried to take out a mortgage on a ninth house. He hasn&#x2019;t <em>failed</em>, you see, he&#x2019;s just had a <em>learning experience.</em></p>

  <p>That&#x2019;s what happens when you refuse to lose hope.</p>

  <p>While this behavior may seem to be merely stupid, it also puts me in mind of two Nobel-Prize-winning economists . . .</p>

  <p>. . . namely Merton and Scholes of Long-Term Capital Management.</p>

  <p>While LTCM raked in giant profits over its first three years, in 1998 the inefficiences that LTCM were exploiting had started to vanish&#x2014;other people knew about the trick, so it stopped working.</p>

  <p>LTCM refused to lose hope. Addicted to 40% annual returns, they borrowed more and more leverage to exploit tinier and tinier margins. When everything started to go wrong for LTCM, they had equity of $4.72 billion, leverage of $124.5 billion, and derivative positions of $1.25 trillion.</p>

  <p>Every profession has a different way to be smart&#x2014;different skills to learn and rules to follow. You might therefore think that the study of &#x201C;rationality,&#x201D; as a general discipline, wouldn&#x2019;t have much to contribute to real-life success. And yet it seems to me that <em>how to not be stupid</em> has a great deal in common across professions. If you set out to teach someone <em>how to not turn little mistakes into big mistakes</em>, it&#x2019;s nearly the same art whether in hedge funds or romance, and one of the keys is this: Be ready to admit you lost.</p>
