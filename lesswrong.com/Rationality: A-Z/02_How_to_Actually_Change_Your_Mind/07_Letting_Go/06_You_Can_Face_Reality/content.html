  <p>Owning up to it doesn&#x2019;t make it worse.</p>

  <p>Not being open about it doesn&#x2019;t make it go away.</p>

  <p>And because it&#x2019;s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.</p>

  <p>Anything untrue isn&#x2019;t there to be lived.</p>

  <p>People can stand what is true,</p>

  <p>for they are already enduring it.</p>
