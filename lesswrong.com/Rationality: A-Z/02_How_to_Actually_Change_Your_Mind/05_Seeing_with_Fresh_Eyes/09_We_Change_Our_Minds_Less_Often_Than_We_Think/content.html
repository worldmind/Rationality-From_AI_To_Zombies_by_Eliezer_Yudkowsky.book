    <p>Over the past few years, we have discreetly approached colleagues faced with a choice between job offers, and asked them to estimate the probability that they will choose one job over another. The average confidence in the predicted choice was a modest 66%, but only 1 of the 24 respondents chose the option to which he or she initially assigned a lower probability, yielding an overall accuracy rate of 96%.</p>

  <p>When I first read the words above&#x2014;on August 1st, 2003, at around 3 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon&#x2014;it changed the way I thought. I realized that <em>once I could guess what my answer would be&#x2014;</em>once I could assign a higher probability to deciding one way than other&#x2014;then I had, in all probability, already decided. We change our minds less often than we think. And most of the time we become able to guess what our answer will be within half a second of hearing the question.</p>

  <p>How swiftly that unnoticed moment passes, when we can&#x2019;t yet guess what our answer will be; the tiny window of opportunity for intelligence to act. In questions of choice, as in questions of fact.</p>

  <p>The principle of the bottom line is that only the actual causes of your beliefs determine your effectiveness as a rationalist. Once your belief is fixed, no amount of argument will alter the truth-value; once your decision is fixed, no amount of argument will alter the consequences.</p>

  <p>You might think that you could arrive at a belief, or a decision, by non-rational means, and then try to justify it, and if you found you couldn&#x2019;t justify it, reject it.</p>

  <p>But we change our minds less often&#x2014;<em>much</em> less often&#x2014;than we think.</p>

  <p>I&#x2019;m sure that you can think of at least one occasion in your life when you&#x2019;ve changed your mind. We all can. How about all the occasions in your life when you didn&#x2019;t change your mind? Are they as available, in your heuristic estimate of your competence?</p>

  <p>Between hindsight bias, fake causality, positive bias, anchoring/priming, et cetera, et cetera, and above all the dreaded confirmation bias, once an idea gets into your head, it&#x2019;s probably going to stay there.</p>
