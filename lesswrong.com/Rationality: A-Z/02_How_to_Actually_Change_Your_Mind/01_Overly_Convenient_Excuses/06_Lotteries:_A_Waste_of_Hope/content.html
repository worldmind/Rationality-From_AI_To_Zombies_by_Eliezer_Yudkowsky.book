Some lottery advocates, and even some commentors on <em>Overcoming Bias</em>, have tried to defend lottery-ticket buying as a <em>rational purchase of fantasy</em>&#x2014;paying a dollar for a day&#x2019;s worth of pleasant anticipation, imagining yourself as a millionaire. </p>

  <p>But consider exactly what this implies. It would mean that you&#x2019;re occupying your valuable brain with a fantasy whose real probability is nearly zero&#x2014;a tiny line of likelihood which you, yourself, can do nothing to realize. The lottery balls will decide your future. The fantasy is of wealth that arrives without effort&#x2014;without conscientiousness, learning, charisma, or even patience.<span><sup><a href="#fn1x5" id="fn1x5-bk">1</a></sup></span><span id="x9-10001f1"></span></p>

  <p>Which makes the lottery another kind of sink: a sink of emotional energy. It encourages people to invest their dreams, their hopes for a better future, into an infinitesimal probability. If not for the lottery, maybe they would fantasize about going to technical school, or opening their own business, or getting a promotion at work&#x2014;things they might be able to actually <em>do</em>, hopes that would make them want to become stronger. Their dreaming brains might, in the 20th visualization of the pleasant fantasy, notice a way to really do it. Isn&#x2019;t that what dreams and brains are <em>for</em>? But how can such reality-limited fare compete with the artificially sweetened prospect of instant wealth&#x2014;not after herding a dot-com startup through to IPO, but on Tuesday?</p>

  <p>Seriously, why can&#x2019;t we just say that buying lottery tickets is stupid? Human beings <em>are</em> stupid, from time to time&#x2014;it shouldn&#x2019;t be so surprising a hypothesis.</p>

  <p>Unsurprisingly, the human brain doesn&#x2019;t do 64-bit floating-point arithmetic, and it can&#x2019;t devalue the emotional force of a pleasant anticipation by a factor of 0.00000001 without dropping the line of reasoning entirely. Unsurprisingly, many people don&#x2019;t realize that a numerical calculation of expected utility ought to <em>override</em> or <em>replace</em> their imprecise financial instincts, and instead treat the calculation as merely one <em>argument</em> to be balanced against their pleasant anticipations&#x2014;an emotionally weak argument, since it&#x2019;s made up of mere squiggles on paper, instead of visions of fabulous wealth.</p>

  <p>This seems sufficient to explain the popularity of lotteries. Why do so many arguers feel impelled to defend this classic form of self-destruction?<span><sup><a href="#fn2x5" id="fn2x5-bk">2</a></sup></span><span id="x9-10002f2"></span></p>

  <p>The process of overcoming bias requires (1) first noticing the bias, (2) analyzing the bias in detail, (3) deciding that the bias is bad, (4) figuring out a workaround, and then (5) implementing it. It&#x2019;s unfortunate how many people get through steps 1 and 2 and then bog down in step 3, which by rights should be the easiest of the five. Biases are lemons, not lemonade, and we shouldn&#x2019;t try to make lemonade out of them&#x2014;just burn those lemons <em>down</em>.</p>
