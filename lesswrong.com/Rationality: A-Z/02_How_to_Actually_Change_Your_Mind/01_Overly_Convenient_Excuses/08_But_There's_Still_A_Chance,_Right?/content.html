When Darwin first proposed evolution, it might have been reasonable to doubt it. But this is the twenty-first century. We can <em>read the genes.</em> Humans and chimpanzees have 98% shared DNA. We <em>know</em> humans and chimps are related. It&#x2019;s <em>over.</em>&#x201D; </p>

  <p>He said, &#x201C;Maybe the DNA is just similar by coincidence.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>I said, &#x201C;The odds of that are something like two to the power of seven hundred and fifty million to one.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>He said, &#x201C;But there&#x2019;s still a chance, right?&#x201D;</p>

  <p>Now, there&#x2019;s a number of reasons my past self cannot claim a strict moral victory in this conversation. One reason is that I have no memory of whence I pulled that 2<sup>750,000,000</sup> figure, though it&#x2019;s probably the right meta-order of magnitude. The other reason is that my past self didn&#x2019;t apply the concept of a calibrated confidence. Of all the times over the history of humanity that a human being has calculated odds of 2<sup>750,000,000</sup>:1 against something, they have undoubtedly been wrong more often than once in 2<sup>750,000,000</sup> times. E.g., the shared genes estimate was revised to 95%, not 98%&#x2014;and that may even apply only to the 30,000 known genes and not the entire genome, in which case it&#x2019;s the wrong meta-order of magnitude.</p>

  <p>But I think the other guy&#x2019;s reply is still pretty funny.</p>

  <p>I don&#x2019;t recall what I said in further response&#x2014;probably something like &#x201C;<strong><em>No</em></strong>&#x201D;&#x2014;but I remember this occasion because it brought me several insights into the laws of thought as seen by the unenlightened ones.</p>

  <p>It first occurred to me that human intuitions were making a qualitative distinction between &#x201C;No chance&#x201D; and &#x201C;A very tiny chance, but worth keeping track of.&#x201D; You can see this in the <em>Overcoming Bias</em> lottery debate.</p>

  <p>The problem is that probability theory sometimes lets us calculate a chance which is, indeed, too tiny to be worth the mental space to keep track of it&#x2014;but by that time, you&#x2019;ve already calculated it. People mix up the map with the territory, so that on a gut level, tracking a symbolically described probability feels like &#x201C;a chance worth keeping track of,&#x201D; even if the <em>referent</em> of the symbolic description is a number so tiny that if it were a dust speck, you couldn&#x2019;t see it. We can use words to describe numbers that small, but not feelings&#x2014;a feeling that small doesn&#x2019;t exist, doesn&#x2019;t fire enough neurons or release enough neurotransmitters to be felt. This is why people buy lottery tickets&#x2014;no one can <em>feel</em> the smallness of a probability that small.</p>

  <p>But what I found even more fascinating was the qualitative distinction between &#x201C;certain&#x201D; and &#x201C;uncertain&#x201D; arguments, where if an argument is not certain, you&#x2019;re allowed to ignore it. Like, if the likelihood is zero, then you have to give up the belief, but if the likelihood is one over googol, you&#x2019;re allowed to keep it.</p>

  <p>Now it&#x2019;s a free country and no one should put you in jail for illegal reasoning, but if you&#x2019;re going to ignore an argument that says the likelihood is one over googol, why not also ignore an argument that says the likelihood is zero? I mean, as long as you&#x2019;re ignoring the evidence anyway, why is it so much worse to ignore certain evidence than uncertain evidence?</p>

  <p>I have often found, in life, that I have learned from other people&#x2019;s nicely blatant bad examples, duly generalized to more subtle cases. In this case, the flip lesson is that, if you can&#x2019;t ignore a likelihood of one over googol because you want to, you can&#x2019;t ignore a likelihood of 0.9 because you want to. It&#x2019;s all the same slippery cliff.</p>

  <p>Consider his example if you ever you find yourself thinking, &#x201C;But you can&#x2019;t <em>prove</em> me wrong.&#x201D; If you&#x2019;re going to ignore a probabilistic counterargument, why not ignore a proof, too?</p>
