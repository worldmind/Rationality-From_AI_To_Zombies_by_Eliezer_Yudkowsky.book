<p>I think I understand Moore's Paradox a bit better now, after reading some of the comments on Less Wrong.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#ga">Jimrandomh</a> suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people cannot distinguish between levels of indirection. To them, "I believe X" and "X" are the same thing, and therefore, reasons why it is beneficial to believe X are also reasons why X is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is correct&mdash;relatively young children can understand the concept of having a false belief, which requires separate mental buckets for the map and the territory.&nbsp; But it points in the direction of a similar idea:</p>
<p>Many people may not consciously distinguish between <em>believing </em>something and <em>endorsing</em> it.</p>
<p>After all&mdash;"I believe in democracy" means, colloquially, that you endorse the concept of democracy, not that you believe democracy exists.&nbsp; The word "belief", then, has more than one meaning.&nbsp; We could be looking at a <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/compress-fallac.html">confused word</a> that causes confused thinking (or maybe it just reflects pre-existing confusion).</p>
<p>So: in the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/">original example</a>, "I believe people are nicer than they are", she came up with some reasons why it would be good to believe people are nice&mdash;health benefits and such&mdash;and since she now had some warm affect on "believing people are nice", she introspected on this warm affect and concluded, "I believe people are nice".&nbsp; That is, she mistook the <em>positive affect</em> attached to the quoted belief, as signaling <em>her belief in the proposition.</em>&nbsp; At the same time, the world itself seemed like people weren't so nice.&nbsp; So she said, "I believe people are nicer than they are."<em><a id="more"></a></em></p>
<p>And that verges on being an honest mistake&mdash;sort of&mdash;since people are not taught explicitly how to know when they believe something.&nbsp; As in the parable of <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html">the dragon in the garage</a>; the one who says "There is a dragon in my garage&mdash;but it's invisible", does not recognize his <em>anticipation</em> of seeing no dragon, as indicating that he possesses an (accurate) model with no dragon in it.</p>
<p>It's not as if people are <em>trained </em>to recognize when they believe something.&nbsp; It's not like they're ever taught in high school:&nbsp; "What it feels like to actually believe something&mdash;to have that statement in your belief pool&mdash;is that it just seems like the way the world <em>is.</em>&nbsp; You should recognize this feeling, which is actual (unquoted) belief, and distinguish it from having good feelings about a belief that you recognize as a belief (which means that it's in quote marks)."</p>
<p>This goes a long way toward making this real-life case of Moore's Paradox <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/">seem less alien</a>, and providing another mechanism whereby people can be <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1d/simultaneously_right_and_wrong/">simultaneously right and wrong</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#gk">Kurige</a> who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that there is a God&mdash;and that He has instilled a sense of right and wrong in us by which we are able to evaluate the world around us.&nbsp; I also believe a sense of morality has been evolutionarily programmed into us&mdash;a sense of morality that is most likely a result of the formation of meta-political coalitions in Bonobo communities a very, very long time ago.&nbsp; These two beliefs are not contradictory, but the complexity lies in reconciling the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect, Kurige, you have decided that you have <em>reasons to endorse</em> the quoted belief that God has instilled a sense of right and wrong in us.&nbsp; And also that you have reasons to endorse the verdict of science.&nbsp; They both seem like good communities to join, right?&nbsp; There are benefits to both sets of beliefs?&nbsp; You introspect and find that you feel good about both beliefs?</p>
<p>But you did <em>not </em>say:</p>
<p>"God instilled a sense of right and wrong in us, and also a sense of morality has been evolutionarily programmed into us.&nbsp; The two states of reality are not inconsistent, but the complexity lies in reconciling the two."</p>
<p>If you're reading this, Kurige, you should very quickly say the above out loud, so you can notice that it seems at least slightly harder to swallow&mdash;notice the <em>subjective difference</em>&mdash;before you go to the trouble of rerationalizing.</p>
<p>This is the subjective difference between having reasons to endorse two different beliefs, and your mental model of a single world, a single way-things-are.</p>
