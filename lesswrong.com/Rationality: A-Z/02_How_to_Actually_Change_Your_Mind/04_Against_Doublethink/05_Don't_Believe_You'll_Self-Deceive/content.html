<p>I don't mean to seem like I'm picking on Kurige, but I think you have to expect a certain amount of questioning if you show up on Less Wrong and <a href="/lw/r/no_really_ive_deceived_myself/#gk">say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing I've come to realize that helps to explain the disparity I feel when I talk with most other Christians is the fact that somewhere along the way my world-view took a major shift away from blind faith and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Orwellian double-think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"If you <em>know</em> it's <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/doublethink-cho.html">double-think</a>...</p>
<p>...how can you still <em>believe </em>it?" I helplessly want to say.</p>
<p><a href="/lw/1f/moores_paradox/#u3">Or</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I chose to believe in the existence of God&mdash;deliberately and consciously. This decision, however, has absolutely zero effect on the actual existence of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you <em>know </em>your belief isn't correlated to reality, how can you still believe it?</p>
<p>Shouldn't the <em>gut-level</em> realization, "Oh, wait, the sky really <em>isn't</em> green" follow from the realization "My map that says 'the sky is green' has no reason to be correlated with the territory"?</p>
<p>Well... apparently not.</p>
<p>One part of this puzzle may be my explanation of <a href="/lw/1f/moores_paradox/">Moore's Paradox</a> ("It's raining, but I don't believe it is")&mdash;that people introspectively mistake positive affect attached to a quoted belief, for actual credulity.</p>
<p>But another part of it may just be that&mdash;contrary to the indignation I initially wanted to put forward&mdash;it's actually quite <em>easy</em> not to make the jump from "The map that reflects the territory would say 'X'" to actually believing "X".&nbsp; It takes some work to <em>explain</em> the ideas of <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/09/what-is-evidenc.html">minds as map-territory correspondence builders</a>, and even then, it may take more work to get the implications on a <em>gut level</em>.<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>I realize now that when I <a href="/lw/1f/moores_paradox/">wrote</a> "You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will", I wasn't just a dispassionate reporter of the existing facts.&nbsp; I was also trying to instill a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>It may be wise to go around deliberately repeating "I can't get away with double-thinking!&nbsp; Deep down, I'll know it's not true!&nbsp; If I know my map has no reason to be correlated with the territory, that means I don't believe it!"</p>
<p>Because that way&mdash;if you're ever tempted to try&mdash;the thoughts "But I know this isn't really true!" and "I can't fool myself!" will always rise readily to mind; and that way, you will indeed be less likely to fool yourself successfully.&nbsp; You're more likely to get, on a gut level, that telling yourself X doesn't make X true: and therefore, really truly not-X.</p>
<p>If you keep telling yourself that you <em>can't</em> just deliberately choose to believe the sky is green&mdash;then you're less likely to succeed in fooling yourself on one level or another; either in the sense of really believing it, or of falling into <a href="/lw/1f/moores_paradox/">Moore's Paradox</a>, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/belief-in-belie.html">belief in belief</a>, or <a href="/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/">belief in self-deception</a>.</p>
<p>If you keep telling yourself that deep down you'll know&mdash;</p>
<p>If you keep telling yourself that you'd just look at your elaborately constructed false map, and just know that it was a false map without any expected correlation to the territory, and therefore, despite all its elaborate construction, you wouldn't be able to invest any credulity in it&mdash;</p>
<p>If you keep telling yourself that reflective consistency will take over and make you stop believing on the object level, once you come to the meta-level realization that the map is not reflecting&mdash;</p>
<p>Then when push comes to shove&mdash;you may, indeed, fail.</p>
<p>When it comes to deliberate self-deception, you must <em>believe in your own inability!</em></p>
<p>Tell yourself the effort is doomed&mdash;<em>and it will be!</em></p>
<p>Is that the power of positive thinking, or the power of negative thinking?&nbsp; Either way, it seems like a wise precaution.</p>
