Most experiments present the subjects with options, and the subject chooses an option, and that&#x2019;s the experimental result. The frugalists realized that in real life, you have to <em>generate</em> your options, and they studied how subjects did <em>that.</em> </p>

  <p>Likewise, although many experiments present evidence on a silver platter, in real life you have to gather evidence, which may be costly, and at some point decide that you have enough evidence to stop and choose. When you&#x2019;re buying a house, you don&#x2019;t get exactly ten houses to choose from, and you aren&#x2019;t led on a guided tour of all of them before you&#x2019;re allowed to decide anything. You look at one house, and another, and compare them to each other; you adjust your aspirations&#x2014;reconsider how much you really need to be close to your workplace and how much you&#x2019;re really willing to pay; you decide which house to look at next; and at some point you decide that you&#x2019;ve seen enough houses, and choose.</p>

  <p>Gilovich&#x2019;s distinction between <em>motivated skepticism</em> and <em>motivated credulity</em> highlights how conclusions a person does not want to believe are held to a higher standard than conclusions a person wants to believe. A motivated skeptic asks if the evidence <em>compels</em> them to accept the conclusion; a motivated credulist asks if the evidence <em>allows</em> them to accept the conclusion.</p>

  <p>I suggest that an analogous bias in psychologically realistic search is <em>motivated stopping</em> and <em>motivated continuation</em>: when we have a <em>hidden</em> motive for choosing the &#x201C;best&#x201D; current option, we have a hidden motive to stop, and choose, and reject consideration of any more options. When we have a hidden motive to reject the current best option, we have a hidden motive to suspend judgment pending additional evidence, to generate more options&#x2014;to find something, anything, to do <em>instead</em> of coming to a conclusion.</p>

  <p>A major historical scandal in statistics was R. A. Fisher, an eminent founder of the field, insisting that no <em>causal</em> link had been established between smoking and lung cancer. &#x201C;Correlation is not causation,&#x201D; he testified to Congress. Perhaps smokers had a gene which both predisposed them to smoke and predisposed them to lung cancer.</p>

  <p>Or maybe Fisher&#x2019;s being employed as a consultant for tobacco firms gave him a hidden motive to decide that the evidence already gathered was insufficient to come to a conclusion, and it was better to keep looking. Fisher was also a smoker himself, and died of colon cancer in 1962.<span><sup><a href="#fn1x32" id="fn1x32-bk">1</a></sup></span><span id="x38-39001f1"></span></p>

  <p>Like many other forms of motivated skepticism, motivated continuation can try to disguise itself as virtuous rationality. Who can argue against gathering more evidence?<span><sup><a href="#fn2x32" id="fn2x32-bk">2</a></sup></span><span id="x38-39002f2"></span></p>

  <p>I can. Evidence is often costly, and worse, slow, and there is certainly nothing virtuous about refusing to integrate the evidence you already have. You can always change your mind later.<span><sup><a href="#fn3x32" id="fn3x32-bk">3</a></sup></span><span id="x38-39003f3"></span></p>

  <p>As for motivated stopping, it appears in every place a third alternative is feared, and wherever you have an argument whose obvious counterargument you would rather not see, and in other places as well. It appears when you pursue a course of action that makes you feel good just for acting, and so you&#x2019;d rather not investigate how well your plan <em>really</em> worked, for fear of destroying the warm glow of moral satisfaction you paid good money to purchase.<span><sup><a href="#fn4x32" id="fn4x32-bk">4</a></sup></span><span id="x38-39004f4"> It appears wherever your beliefs and anticipations get out of sync, so you have a reason to fear any new evidence gathered.<span><sup><a href="#fn5x32" id="fn5x32-bk">5</a></sup></span><span id="x38-39005f5"></span></span></p>

  <p>The moral is that the decision to terminate a search procedure (temporarily or permanently) is, like the search procedure itself, subject to bias and hidden motives. You should suspect motivated stopping when you close off search, after coming to a comfortable conclusion, and yet there&#x2019;s a lot of fast cheap evidence you haven&#x2019;t gathered yet&#x2014;there are websites you could visit, there are counter-counter arguments you could consider, or you haven&#x2019;t closed your eyes for five minutes by the clock trying to think of a better option. You should suspect motivated continuation when some evidence is leaning in a way you don&#x2019;t like, but you decide that more evidence is needed&#x2014;<em>expensive</em> evidence that you know you can&#x2019;t gather anytime soon, as opposed to something you&#x2019;re going to look up on Google in thirty minutes&#x2014;before you&#x2019;ll have to do anything uncomfortable.</p>
