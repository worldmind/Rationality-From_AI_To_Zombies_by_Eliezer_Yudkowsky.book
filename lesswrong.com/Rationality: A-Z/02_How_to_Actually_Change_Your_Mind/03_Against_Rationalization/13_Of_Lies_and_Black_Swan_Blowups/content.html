  <p>. . . went to jail for two years over a series of perjuries and lies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Einfeld">that started with a $77, 6-mph-over speeding ticket</a>.</p>

  <p>That whole <em>suspiciously virtuous-sounding</em> theory about honest people not being good at lying, and entangled traces being left somewhere, and the entire thing blowing up in a Black Swan epic fail, actually <em>does</em> have a certain number of exemplars in real life, though obvious selective reporting is at work in our hearing about this one.</p>
