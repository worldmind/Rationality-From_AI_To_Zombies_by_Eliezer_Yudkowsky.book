Here I suggest that when people encounter a contrary argument, they prevent themselves from downshifting their confidence by <em>rehearsing</em> already-known support. </p>

  <p>Suppose the country of Freedonia is debating whether its neighbor, Sylvania, is responsible for a recent rash of meteor strikes on its cities. There are several pieces of evidence suggesting this: the meteors struck cities close to the Sylvanian border; there was unusual activity in the Sylvanian stock markets <em>before</em> the strikes; and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino was heard muttering about &#x201C;heavenly vengeance.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>Someone comes to you and says: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think Sylvania is responsible for the meteor strikes. They have trade with us of billions of dinars annually.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; you reply, &#x201C;the meteors struck cities close to Sylvania, there was suspicious activity in their stock market, and their ambassador spoke of heavenly vengeance afterward.&#x201D; Since these three arguments outweigh the first, you <em>keep</em> your belief that Sylvania is responsible&#x2014;you believe rather than disbelieve, qualitatively. Clearly, the balance of evidence weighs against Sylvania.</p>

  <p>Then another comes to you and says: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think Sylvania is responsible for the meteor strikes. Directing an asteroid strike is really hard. Sylvania doesn&#x2019;t even have a space program.&#x201D; You reply, &#x201C;But the meteors struck cities close to Sylvania, and their investors knew it, and the ambassador came right out and admitted it!&#x201D; Again, these three arguments outweigh the first (by three arguments against one argument), so you keep your belief that Sylvania is responsible.</p>

  <p>Indeed, your convictions are <em>strengthened.</em> On two separate occasions now, you have evaluated the balance of evidence, and both times the balance was tilted against Sylvania by a ratio of 3 to 1.</p>

  <p>You encounter further arguments by the pro-Sylvania traitors&#x2014;again, and again, and a hundred times again&#x2014;but each time the new argument is handily defeated by 3 to 1. And on every occasion, you feel yourself becoming more confident that Sylvania was indeed responsible, shifting your prior according to the felt balance of evidence.</p>

  <p>The problem, of course, is that by <em>rehearsing</em> arguments you <em>already knew</em>, you are double-counting the evidence. This would be a grave sin even if you double-counted <em>all</em> the evidence. (Imagine a scientist who does an experiment with 50 subjects and fails to obtain statistically significant results, so the scientist counts all the data twice.)</p>

  <p>But to selectively double-count <em>only some</em> evidence is sheer farce. I remember seeing a cartoon as a child, where a villain was dividing up loot using the following algorithm: &#x201C;One for you, one for me. One for you, one-two for me. One for you, one-two-three for me.&#x201D;</p>

  <p>As I emphasized in the last essay, even if a cherished belief is <em>true</em>, a rationalist may sometimes need to downshift the probability while integrating <em>all</em> the evidence. Yes, the balance of support may still favor your cherished belief. But you still have to shift the probability <em>down</em>&#x2014;yes, <em>down</em>&#x2014;from whatever it was before you heard the contrary evidence. It does no good to <em>rehearse</em> supporting arguments, because you have already taken those into account.</p>

  <p>And yet it does appear to me that when people are confronted by a <em>new</em> counterargument, they search for a justification not to downshift their confidence, and of course they find supporting arguments they <em>already know.</em> I have to keep constant vigilance not to do this myself! It feels as natural as parrying a sword-strike with a handy shield.</p>

  <p>With the right kind of wrong reasoning, a handful of support&#x2014;or even a single argument&#x2014;can stand off an army of contradictions.</p>
